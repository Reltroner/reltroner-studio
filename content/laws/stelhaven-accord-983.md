# 📜 The Stelhaven (Kalgered) Accord

**Date Ratified**: 983 BAC  
**Location**: Kalgered Assembly Dome, Global Forum of Stelhaven

## 🌐 Overview

The *Stelhaven Accord*—also known as the *Kalgered Convention*—stands as the earliest comprehensive planetary treaty within the history of Asthortera. It was the **first global charter** to bind the civilizations of the planet under a shared legal and ethical framework, aiming to prevent continental conflicts and enable cooperative sentient development.

## 📘 Founding Principles

1. **Global Legal Recognition**  
   All sovereign nations shall be recognized under a unified legal codex that affirms territorial integrity, basic rights of sentient life, and governance autonomy.

2. **International Military Limitation Clause**  
   Militaries may not operate outside of national boundaries unless:  
   a. Under a mutual defense pact  
   b. Approved by the Global Defense Tribunal  
   c. In declared global emergencies ratified by the Accord Council

3. **Trade Unity & Tariff Reduction**  
   Member nations agree to reduce artificial trade barriers and align on standardized resource classifications to accelerate economic interoperability.

4. **Diplomatic Immunity Charter**  
   Diplomats of all nations, regardless of ideology, shall be protected under a neutral immunity clause to ensure continuous dialogue during crises.

5. **Judicial Synergy**  
   A special intercontinental court (Global Harmonization Bench) is established to resolve cross-border disputes with binding rulings recognized by all signatories.

6. **Cultural Non-Interference Act**  
   Member states agree not to forcibly alter, erase, or rewrite the cultural identities of other nations or peoples.

## 🕊️ Legacy

The Stelhaven Accord laid the **legal groundwork** for modern diplomatic stability in Asthortera. While challenged during the Reltronland-Depcutland tensions, the core articles remained intact and continued to serve as a reference for treaties like:
- The *Troncut Treaty* (1010 BAC)
- The *Interplanetary Transit Accord* (1008 BAC)
- The *Treaty of Virelyn* (71 AC)

Even in the age of interstellar expansion, the Stelhaven Accord remains the **philosophical ancestor** of Asthortera's sentient-rights doctrine.
