# 🕊️ Aurastelia Governance Model  
### *The Harmonial Monarchy of Enlightened Resonance*

---

## 👑 Overview

Aurastelia is governed by a **spiritual-functional hybrid system**, designed not to control citizens, but to **resonate with their consciousness**.  
This model is known as a **Harmonial Monarchy** — a form of leadership that blends monarchy, spiritual wisdom, and participatory balance.

At its heart stands **Queen Valethra Seraphine Lunara**, not as a ruler of power, but as a *Mirror of Inner Aurora* — embodying clarity, compassion, and cosmic direction.

## 🪷 Core Components

### 1. 👑 **The Aurora Queen**  
- **Role**: Symbol of spiritual clarity and final harmonizer of national decisions  
- **Power**: Does not impose law, but provides *aurora blessing* to policies that align with national consciousness  
- **Selection**: Her role is hereditary, but continuation depends on her sustained resonance with the people  
- **Limitations**: Cannot override collective resonance or silence dissent — she leads through presence, not control

---

### 2. 🧠 **Council of Resonant Ministers (CRM)**  
- **Function**: Manages state operations, policies, education, ecology, health, and interstellar diplomacy  
- **Selection**: Chosen through *Aurora Resonance Evaluations*, not political votes  
- **Accountability**: Must maintain inner balance and report to both the Queen and the Sentient Public

---

### 3. 🌌 **Public Lumina Circle**  
- **What it is**: A biannual spiritual forum, not a political campaign  
- **How it works**: Citizens gather in sacred locations to express harmony, concerns, and aspirations through rituals, poems, silence, or aurora expression  
- **Purpose**: To reflect the collective state of national consciousness, which guides CRM decisions and Queen’s reflection

---

### 4. 📿 **The Role of Aurora Sancta**  
- The spiritual system that shapes the moral compass of both people and leaders  
- Provides guidance on how to act with integrity, rest without guilt, lead without pride, and exist without oppression
