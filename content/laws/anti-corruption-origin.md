# ‚öñÔ∏è The Origin of Absolute Law

Reltronland‚Äôs uncompromising anti-corruption laws are not accidental‚Äîthey are the **final evolution of centuries of resistance** against systemic decay, originating from the chaos of the once-powerful planet: **Depeisit**.

---

## üåç I. Collapse of Planet Depeisit

Depeisit once stood as a galactic superpower. But its downfall was inevitable.
- Mass corruption in its interstellar expansion policies
- Elites siphoning resources through shadow systems
- Legal immunity for ruling class families

> "Justice was ornamental. Power was inherited. Collapse was destiny."

This collapse gave birth to the **first raw anti-corruption doctrines**, written in desperation‚Äînot justice.

---

## üèõÔ∏è II. Depcutland‚Äôs Legal Enlightenment

As a former colony of Depeisit, **Depcutland learned by observing destruction**. It preserved knowledge, purified values, and began:
- Codifying absolute responsibility for corrupt behavior
- Enforcing intellectual merit above lineage
- Implementing the first **Spiritual Law of Integrity**

> "In Depcutland, the law does not forgive the brilliant who betray it."

Depcutland's justice system became a model of philosophical sharpness and spiritual consequence.

## üèôÔ∏è III. Reltronland: Ascension Through Absolutism

Reltronland, born from **Astralis Pinnacle‚Äôs ideology**, adopted Depcutland‚Äôs framework and **perfected it.**

### Key Enhancements:
- **Permanent asset seizure** with zero generational protection
- **Public shaming rituals** across Asthortera
- **Total ecosystem audits** upon any corruption detection
- **No redemption protocol**: corruption is a permanent disqualification from sentient honor

> "We do not punish to reform. We punish to purify the realm."

Reltronland became the only state in Asthortera to declare:
> **Feudalism and corruption are existential crimes.**

---

## üî• Legacy and Enforcement

Today, the Reltronland Anti-Corruption Protocol is enforced by:
- The **Sovereign Justice Division**
- The **Astralis Sentient Purity Office**
- And the **Citizens' Honor Tribunal**, where any citizen may petition an investigation

It is not a flexible system.
It is a firewall against collapse.

> **‚ÄúReltronland does not tolerate shadows. It annihilates them with light.‚Äù**
