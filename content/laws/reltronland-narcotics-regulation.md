### ❗ Statement of Purpose

The High Sentient Authority of Reltronland hereby acknowledges the existential threat posed by the circulation, consumption, and distribution of narcotics and other mind-altering substances. These agents are deemed hostile instruments of Nytherion Abyss, capable of corrupting judgment, eroding social fabric, and inducing irreversible decay in civilization quality.

### 🔒 Core Mandates

- 🚫 Ban all forms of narcotics, hard drugs, synthetic hallucinogens, illegal stimulants, and mind-deteriorating substances.
- 🛡️ Criminalize all forms of production, trafficking, possession, and distribution without exception.
- 🧠 Declare any attempt to justify usage under the guise of "recreation" or "freedom" as void and non-defensible under Reltronland Civil Code.

### 🔨 Capital Enforcement Clause

> **"Any individual or entity found guilty of deliberate production, trafficking, or mass distribution of Class-A Forbidden Substances will face irreversible execution under the Death Mandate, without pardon or appeal."**

- This includes cartel leaders, network organizers, chemical engineers of illegal substances, and repeat offenders.
- Capital punishment is enforced only when guilt is proven beyond all dimensions of doubt via multispectrum forensic evidence and astral consensus review.
