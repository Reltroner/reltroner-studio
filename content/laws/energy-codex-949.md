> — Opening Decree, Energy Codex 949 BAC

### 📜 Purpose of the Codex
The Energy Codex of Year 949 BAC was established to **regulate and spiritually align all energy extraction, distribution, and usage across Asthortera**, ensuring that technology evolves **with sentient dignity and ecological equilibrium**.

---

### 🔹 Core Principles

1. **Sentient Supremacy Clause**  
   All energy infrastructure must prioritize the **dignity, safety, and evolution of sentient life**.

2. **Dimensional Consent Doctrine**  
   No planetary or dimensional energy source may be extracted without **cosmic alignment verification**.

3. **Abyssal Energy Ban**  
   All forms of energy originating from **Nytherion Abyss** or corrupted frequencies are declared forbidden.

4. **Spiritual Circuitry Integration**  
   Any high-energy system (especially anti-matter and aurora tech) must integrate **spiritual or emotional consciousness modulating components**.

5. **Energy Debt Prohibition**  
   No nation, entity, or AI may hold other beings hostage through energy dependency, artificial scarcity, or exploitative monopolies.
