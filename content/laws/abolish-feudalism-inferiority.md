# 🚫 Abolishment Decree: Feudalism & Inferiority Mentality

## 📜 Article FIM-1 — The Prohibition of Feudal Hierarchies and Inferior Self-Identities

---

### 🧭 Purpose

To ensure that all sentient beings in Reltronland are liberated from the suppressive systems of **feudal submission** and **internalized inferiority**, this decree bans all doctrines, cultures, behaviors, and social systems that perpetuate oppressive hierarchies and devalue self-worth based on birth, class, background, or past failure.

### 🔥 Pillars of Abyssal Contamination

- 🏰 **Feudalism:** Enforces blind loyalty, hierarchical stagnation, and class-based obedience.
- 🧠 **Inferiority Mentality:** Cultivates passive compliance, hopelessness, and resistance to growth.

---

### ❌ Prohibited Practices

- 🔻 Establishing rigid hierarchical structures based on non-meritocratic grounds (birthright, favoritism, titles).
- 🔻 Teaching or promoting ideologies that glorify submission to unearned authority.
- 🔻 Institutionalized belittlement or discouragement of self-worth and ambition.
- 🔻 Self-sabotaging narratives such as “I am not good enough to try,” unless part of a recovery program.

### ⚖️ Enforcement Directives

- 🛑 Dismantle feudal-based organizations or institutions within 30 planetary cycles.
- 🧠 Introduce *Clarity Curriculum* to all educational tiers, emphasizing self-agency and merit.
- 🧾 Audit workplaces, schools, and cultural networks for symptoms of hierarchical rot.
- 📉 Penalize leadership structures that weaponize authority for personal worship or suppression.
