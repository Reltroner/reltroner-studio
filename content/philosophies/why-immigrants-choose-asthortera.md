# 🌍 Why Immigrants Choose Asthortera

> *“Kardashev measures power. SDI measures soul. Asthortera balances both.”*\
> — Reltronland Migration Report, Year 784 BAC

### 🔹 Despite a Lower Kardashev Rating…

Asthortera is a **Type 1.9 civilization**, lower than:

- **Depeisit (2.2)**
- **Cistheta (2.4)**
- **Cosmeilia (2.5+)**

But it surpasses all of them in **SDI (Sentient Development Index)** with a score of **0.921**—the highest in the galaxy.

### 🔸 Core Reasons Immigrants Prefer Asthortera

1. **Highest Quality of Life (SDI 0.921)**\
   Inclusive healthcare, universal education, clean environments, and career mobility for all sentient species.

2. **Ethical Energy Governance**\
   Powered by the **Energy Codex Year 949 BAC**, Asthortera prohibits exploitative systems and prioritizes conscious technology.

3. **True Meritocracy**\
   Citizenship, careers, and advancement based on contribution—not origin or wealth. No feudalism, no class oppression.

4. **Spiritual + Scientific Harmony**\
   A rare equilibrium of spiritual growth and technological innovation—seen especially in Reltronland and Aurastelia.

5. **Cultural Openness**\
   Immigrants are not just tolerated—they are **welcomed, integrated, and empowered** through social mentorship and Aurora-based education systems.

6. **A Refuge from Chaos**

   - From **Depeisit’s hyper-capitalist pressure**
   - From **Cistheta’s scientific militarism**
   - From **Cosmeilia’s inaccessible abstraction**
