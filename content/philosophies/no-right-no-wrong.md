# 📜 There is No Right or Wrong in Worldbuilding

> “In the realm of creation, truth is not measured by accuracy — but by coherence.”

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

Worldbuilding is not a game of passing or failing.  
It is a **creative logic system** where you, the creator, define the rules — and the rules evolve with you.

There is no *right or wrong* — only:
- **Consistency or chaos**
- **Harmony or contradiction**
- **Depth or confusion**

But never guilt. Never punishment.

## 🛠️ Why This Matters

Unlike academic writing, worldbuilding is not bound to external correctness.  
You’re not answering a textbook.  
You’re answering the question:  
**“What would this world become if this truth were true?”**

The process is exploratory — not evaluative.

## 💡 Guidelines Over Rules

In Reltroner Studio, world logic is not enforced by judgment.  
It is enforced by meaning.

### 🧭 Worldbuilding Logic Guide

- **🏛️ Population Pyramids**  
  → *Guided by:* Spiritual Demography

- **♾️ Immortal Characters**  
  → *Guided by:* Memory Anchoring

- **⚖️ Social Laws**  
  → *Guided by:* Narrative Consistency

- **🏗️ Architecture & Design**  
  → *Guided by:* Symbolic Relevance

> “Every city, every policy, every star system... means something, or it means nothing.”

## 🔍 Common Myths Broken

- **“But this doesn’t make sense in real life!”**  
  → *Good. That’s how you know it’s original.*

- **“But that’s not how it works on Earth.”**  
  → *Perfect. Asthortera is not Earth.*

- **“No one else does this.”**  
  → *Exactly. That’s your power.*
