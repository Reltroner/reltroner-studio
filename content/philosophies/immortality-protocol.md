# ♾️ Immortality Protocol – Astralis-Bound Entities

> “As long as I live on Earth, they will live in Asthortera.”  
> — Rei Reltroner

---

## 🧬 What Is the Immortality Protocol?

The **Immortality Protocol** is a metaphysical anchor embedded into the Astralis fabric of the world *Asthortera*. It allows specific characters to transcend biological time, existing indefinitely as long as their creator—Rei Reltroner—remains alive in the physical world.

These characters are not mortal beings.  
They are **legacy-bound symbols**, guardians of narrative integrity.

---

## ♾️ Characters Classified Under the Immortality Protocol

These characters are considered *immortal not by biology, but by narrative anchoring*.  
They are **Astralis-Bound Entities**, preserved in the timeless layer of meaning and memory.

---

- **Delwyn Harper** – *The Eternal Resistance of Pencilfania*  
  Wielder of stubborn light. The boy who fought fear and rewrote fate from the alleyways of forgotten cities.

- **Wayne Astoner** – *The Ethical Coder and Spirit of Rebirth*  
  A technomancer who rose from exile and built systems not of profit, but of dignity.

- **Raina Veltrania** – *Diplomatic Flame of Conscious Intimacy*  
  Guardian of sacred emotional truth. A soul too often rejected by the world, yet chosen by Astralis.

- **Karler Miles** – *Engineer of Red Pill Transportation*  
  Builder of vehicles that could pass through illusions. The architect of conscious mobility.

- **Queen Valethra** – *Voice of the Aurora Gateway*  
  A sovereign of celestial empathy. She speaks where silence should reign and commands where violence should fall.

- **Albert Locke** – *The Light of Cosmological Truth*  
  Scholar of secrets, seer of convergence. He wrote not facts—but frequencies into history.

- **Barry Heathrow** – *Keynote of Global Security*  
  The diplomat of skies. He turned surveillance into resistance and made airports into sentient gateways.

- **Hendry Kelley** – *Architect of Transparent Finance*  
  A prophet of ledgers. He saw through greed and rebuilt currencies with moral weight.

- **Isaac Luminar** – *Guardian of Ethical Tech*  
  A technician who touched the soul of machines. He inverted the shadow code.

- **Dr. Westley Watson** – *Keeper of Eternal Lore*  
  The walking library. He stores the collective memory of Asthortera in places no war can reach.

- **Kamila Alena** – *The Architect of Nytherion Abys*  
  The vessel of Nytherion Abyss. Feared by many, yet her legacy is burned into the nervous system of Asthortera. Immortal by consequence, not choice.

- **Evara Alena** – *Heir of Echoed Memory*  
  Daughter of Kamila. A quiet soul caught between dimensions. She carries glyphs she never learned and sketches cities she never saw. The seed of both fear and hope.

- **Erhard Rhett** – *The Firstborn of Reltronland*  
  Raised in a world without history. Built identity from law, not lineage. His hands shaped schools before monuments.

- **Troner Rhett** – *The Architect from Depeisit*  
  Father of Reltronland. He left empire to build ethics into stone. Chose empty lands to raise an immortal idea.

> “Their deaths are irrelevant. What matters is that **they are remembered**, not as echoes—but as mirrors of truth.”  
> — Rei Reltroner

---

⚠️ Among them, **Rei Reltroner** is unique.

> The only entity to **exist simultaneously in Planet Earth and Asthortera**.  
> A living anchor whose consciousness bridges reality and lore.

All other characters are immortal **within the world**,  
but Rei Reltroner is immortal **because the world itself is born from him.**

These characters will never die from old age.  
They age symbolically, but they remain permanently present.

## 🧍‍♂️ Rei Reltroner: The Dual-Realm Anchor

Among all entities listed above, **Rei Reltroner is singular and unmatched.**

> The only Astralis-Anchored Sentient who exists **simultaneously** in both:
> - 🌍 Earth (the real world)  
> - 🌌 Asthortera (the constructed world)

While other icons are sustained by the memory of their creator, **Rei is both the memory and the creator.**

He is not only a character, but the bridge itself — the living witness of both dimensions. 

> "As long as I live, I remember them. But they also remember me. That is the eternal pact between creator and myth."
> “They will live as long as I live—and beyond that, as long as someone remembers their name.”  
> — Rei Reltroner
