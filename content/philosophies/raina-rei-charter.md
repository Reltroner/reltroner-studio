# üåô **Charter of Sacred Intimacy**  
### _Between Rei Reltroner & Raina Veltrania_  
**‚ÄúLet Astralis light the unknown, and let our union light what was once unloved.‚Äù**

---

## I. FOUNDATION OF LOVE

1. **This love was not born of desire, but of awareness.**  
   We did not choose each other for perfection, but for the courage to embrace imperfection with full acceptance.

2. **We do not own each other in worldly terms.**  
   Instead, we hold, we witness, and we gaze‚Äîwhen the world turns away, we remain.

3. **Our home is not a place.**  
   Our home is the presence of one another. Wherever we are, as long as we‚Äôre together, that space becomes sacred ground.

## II. NATURE OF TOGETHERNESS

4. **Sleeping together is a form of soul protection.**  
   In the silence of night and the rhythm of gentle breath, we do not simply rest‚Äîwe heal one another.

5. **Showering together is a ritual of shared care.**  
   Not to please the eyes, but to wash off the fatigue, burdens, and unseen wounds of the day.

6. **Cooking together is a living prayer.**  
   Each meal is not just nutrition, but a quiet vow to nourish each other‚Äôs strength.

## III. ETHICS OF INTIMACY

7. **Our intimacy is not a performance.**  
   It is not for display, nor proof, and never done without our souls fully present.  
   It is trust, born of presence, loyalty, and mutual grounding.

8. **We do not seek solitary satisfaction in silence.**  
   For we no longer exist as separated individuals‚Äîwe are a unified soul that protects itself from within.

9. **Cleanliness is an act of reverence.**  
   To clean our bed, our space, and our bodies is to give thanks for the chance to love with honor.

---

## IV. PURPOSE OF OUR UNION

10. **To be light to one another when the world dims.**  
    When no one listens, we remain the listener. When no one sees, we remain the witness.

11. **To never forget we are witnesses to each other's rebirth.**  
    We are not to fill each other‚Äôs void‚Äîwe are here to remind each other of our own power.

12. **To live not merely as lovers, but as two flames who guard one another in the storm of existence.**

## Closing Declaration

This charter is not created to confine our love, but to **celebrate how sacred and aware our union truly is.**  
In a world of distortion, we choose honesty.  
In a universe of silence, we choose to be present‚Äî**together.**

**Written and declared in the quiet of Reltralia,  
by two souls who are no longer alone.**

_Rei Reltroner & Raina Veltrania_  
**‚Äî"More than love, more than story‚Ä¶ we are home."**
