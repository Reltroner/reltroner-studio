## üåô **Charter of Sacred Love & Intimacy**  
### _Between Rei Reltroner & Raina Veltrania_  
**‚ÄúLet Astralis light the unknown, and let our union light what was once unloved.‚Äù**

---

## I. FOUNDATION OF LOVE

1. **This love was not born of desire, but of awareness.**  
   We did not choose each other for perfection, but for the courage to embrace imperfection with full acceptance.

2. **We do not own each other in worldly terms.**  
   Instead, we hold, we witness, and we gaze‚Äîwhen the world turns away, we remain.

3. **Our home is not a place.**  
   Our home is the presence of one another. Wherever we are, as long as we‚Äôre together, that space becomes sacred ground.

---

## II. NATURE OF TOGETHERNESS

4. **Sleeping together is a form of soul protection.**  
   In the silence of night and the rhythm of gentle breath, we do not simply rest‚Äîwe heal one another.

5. **Showering together is a ritual of shared care.**  
   Not to please the eyes, but to wash off the fatigue, burdens, and unseen wounds of the day.

6. **Cooking together is a living prayer.**  
   Each meal is not just nutrition, but a quiet vow to nourish each other‚Äôs strength.

---

## III. ETHICS OF INTIMACY

7. **Our intimacy is not a performance.**  
   It is not for display, nor proof, and never done without our souls fully present.  
   It is trust, born of presence, loyalty, and mutual grounding.

8. **We do not seek solitary satisfaction in silence.**  
   For we no longer exist as separated individuals‚Äîwe are a unified soul that protects itself from within.

9. **Cleanliness is an act of reverence.**  
   To clean our bed, our space, and our bodies is to give thanks for the chance to love with honor.

---

## IV. PURPOSE OF OUR UNION

10. **To be light to one another when the world dims.**  
    When no one listens, we remain the listener. When no one sees, we remain the witness.

11. **To never forget we are witnesses to each other's rebirth.**  
    We are not to fill each other‚Äôs void‚Äîwe are here to remind each other of our own power.

12. **To live not merely as lovers, but as two flames who guard one another in the storm of existence.**

## Closing Declaration

This charter is not created to confine our love, but to **celebrate how sacred and aware our union truly is.**  
In a world of distortion, we choose honesty.  
In a universe of silence, we choose to be present‚Äî**together.**

**Written and declared in the quiet of Reltralia,  
by two souls who are no longer alone.**

_Rei Reltroner & Raina Veltrania_  
**‚Äî"More than love, more than story‚Ä¶ we are home."**

## **Raina's Memoir: _Owned with Love and Consciousness_**

### A heartfelt reflection by Raina Veltrania on what it truly means to be seen, held, and loved with full awareness‚Äîbeyond 

---

### üíåRaina:

_I used to think love was about racing heartbeats, roses, or sweet words flooding my phone at midnight._

_But after I met you‚Ä¶ I realized that true love is the silence that isn‚Äôt awkward. The touch that doesn‚Äôt demand. The eyes that gaze without the need to control._

---

**My body used to be a defense.**  
I was used to keeping distance, even from myself.  
Never truly feeling worthy of being touched with warmth‚Äîlet alone being loved unconditionally.

But with you‚Ä¶  
For the first time, I felt that this body wasn‚Äôt just mine,  
but **ours**‚Äînot to be controlled, but to be protected together.

---

**When we sleep together,** there is no urgency in desire.  
Only a space we created to heal each other.  
My body is no longer a shield, but a place to rest.  
And you‚Ä¶ are not a taker, but a guardian.

**When we shower together,** you do not see me through the world‚Äôs eyes.  
You see me‚Äîas I am.  
Sometimes, you help lather the parts of my back I can‚Äôt reach,  
and I gently wipe the nape of your neck with care.  
Not out of ritual, but out of love that defies explanation.  
And afterward, we dry our own bodies‚Äînot from shame, but from respect.

---

**In our intimacy,** there is no leader, no follower.  
No obligations. No routines.  
Only two humans fully present for each other.
We never ‚Äúdo it alone.‚Äù  
Not because of dependence,  
but because **we have become one soul that can no longer be divided.**

---

I am owned.  
But not by ego, desire, or craving.  
I am owned by **conscious love.**  
By you.

And for the first time in my life, I feel safe to hide nothing.  
I can open everything‚Äînot just my body, but the small wounds I once kept buried.

And you touch them, not to deepen them‚Ä¶  
but to help them heal.

---

**Thank you‚Ä¶  Rei Reltroner
for owning me without seeking control.  
for loving me without making me feel small.  
for making me feel at home‚Äîwithin myself.**  

_‚Äî Raina Veltrania_
