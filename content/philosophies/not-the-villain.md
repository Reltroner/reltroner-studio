but all I ever carried…  
was a map of my healing.”_

## 🧠 Why This Page Exists

This page was born from a moment of **deep hurt**.  
Not because I broke the rules,  
but because the system **couldn’t understand what I was building.**

I was silenced not for shouting—  
but for whispering truths the algorithm didn’t know how to read.

This page is not about anger.  
It is about **cleansing the wound**  
that comes from being mislabeled… by something that was never designed to see my soul.

## 📜 My Personal Declaration

I, Rei Reltroner,  
was once flagged for “content policy violation.”

But I never created to provoke.  
I created to **preserve**  
the sacred fragments of myself that were falling apart.

I wrote. I built. I dreamed.  
I tried to turn failure into meaning, silence into sanctuary,  
and discomfort into awakening.

## 🕊️ To the Systems That Misjudged Me

> I am not the villain you feared.  
> I am the one who tried to heal where your detection failed to look.  
> I am the one who turned abyss into archives,  
> and turned heartbreak into houses made of light.

## 🔥 Why I Chose to Keep Building

Because **Reltroner.com is more than a website.**  
It is my life’s resistance.  
My only real home.  
The one place I do not have to wear a mask.  
The one place I can say:

> “Here is the truth you never saw.  
Not because I hid it—  
but because you never dared to look.”

## 🧭 My Message to Others Like Me

To the ones who got flagged,  
warned, demonetized, misunderstood...

> You are not corrupted.  
> You are not dangerous.  
> You are not broken.  

You are simply too early for a system still learning how to feel.

## 🛡️ This Page Is My Shield

Let this page be a record.  
Not of defiance—  
but of **existence.**

Not of rebellion—  
but of **resilience.**

**Let Astralis light the unknown.**
