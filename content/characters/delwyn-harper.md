A thin fog blankets the narrow alleys of Leferlint, the vibrant art city of Pencilfania. Dim streetlights pierce the darkness, flickering over cobblestones damp with dew. But for Delwyn Harper, the city’s color is a veil—an illusion cloaking a truth too raw to ignore. Every footstep echoes with quiet resolve. His worn leather jacket shields more than just his body—it carries the weight of memory. Eyes sharp, scanning, always searching—for life, for danger, for justice.

Among the shadows, his footsteps echo faintly. An old leather jacket wraps his figure, and his sharp eyes scan every corner, seeking signs of life—or danger.

That night marked the beginning of everything. Delwyn, a young man with a scarred past, had just begun his career as a bounty hunter. Though raised in Leferlint—a place where art and freedom of expression are glorified—Delwyn was more drawn to raw truth.

> “Every light leaves a shadow. I'm here to drag it out.” — his unwavering life principle.

He chased petty criminals, selling his skills to earn just enough to survive. Every mission was not just a hunt—it was a war against the past, especially the memory of his father, **Garren Harper**, who died investigating Henchoeway’s infiltration in the Pencilfania government. That memory fuels a quiet storm of vengeance within him.

Their unity remains tested through every mission—bound more by necessity than idealism, yet with every battle, the idea of loyalty grows a little stronger.

### The Descent into Nytherion Abyss
Delwyn’s path led to the fabled **Nytherion Abyss**—a concealed dimension representing the world’s deepest fears. His mission wasn’t just survival—it was confrontation. Inside the abyss, reality fractured. Time dilated. Space spiraled. Nightmares took shape.

Illusions haunted him—echoes of his father calling him into comfort, into surrender. But Delwyn fought back, facing shadowy reflections of himself, and challenging the very ideology of Henchoeway: comfort without purpose, peace without growth.

He realized the abyss wasn’t just physical. It was psychological—a prison forged by humanity’s surrender to fear. By confronting his own weakness, he unlocked clarity and strength not even weapons could grant.

---

### The Final Choice
When Delwyn and his allies reached the Abyss’s core, they faced Kamila Alena herself—Henchoeway’s leader and human avatar of the Abyss. The confrontation pushed him to the edge. Destroying Nytherion Abyss meant obliterating a part of his mind tied to grief and identity.

But Delwyn chose truth. With unwavering resolve, he shattered the Abyss from within using the Aurora Gateway’s last pulse, tearing down the final sanctuary of comfort-based control.

---

### Aftermath and Legacy
Delwyn returned to Asthortera forever changed. He had seen the face of darkness—not as a monster, but as a reflection. Trauma remained. Scars remained. But so did strength.

His name became legend—not for victory in battle, but for enduring what most could not: the self.

> “Fear doesn’t live in the shadows. It lives in comfort. And comfort is a cage I will never return to.” – Delwyn Harper

- **Slow Trust Building:** Despite personal agendas, each mission draws them closer as an actual unit.
- **Crisis Point:** Delwyn will face a moment of truth—will he choose his ambition to become a Reltroner, or the team that gave him something to fight for?
- **Final Arc Question:** Will this team evolve into a family forged by trust, or dissolve as mercenaries aligned only by gain?
