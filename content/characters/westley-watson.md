## Biography

Dr. Westley Watson is one of the most renowned scholars of Asthortera, known for his deep intellect, calm demeanor, and relentless dedication to uncovering the truth behind Nytherion Abyss. As the Chief Archivist of the Grand Library of Depcutland, he holds a sacred duty to protect ancient records and forbidden knowledge deemed too dangerous for public access.

He was the first person to rediscover fragments of the name "Reltroner" from ancient abyssal texts, which he later handed to Delwyn during their joint expedition. Dr. Watson is among the very few who have witnessed firsthand the residual energies of Nytherion Abyss without succumbing to its illusions.
