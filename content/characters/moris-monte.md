## 🏡 Background

Moris was born on the same day a forgotten PC game called *Mortimer and the Enchanted Castle* was released. Though the game faded into obscurity, for Moris, the first 8 levels became an eternal memory—a digital dreamscape he never got to complete as a child.

He grew up longing to unlock **Level 9**, which remained inaccessible in the trial version. To him, it was more than just a game stage—it was a gate. A boundary. A calling.

## 🏰 Life in Citadeladia

Moris lives in the quiet, historical north of Citadeladia. The town is known for its ancient Germanic castles, cobbled streets, and timeless tranquility. Many locals believe the region hasn't changed in centuries.

For Moris, it feels eerily similar to the first 8 levels of the game. He sees himself *not as a historian*, but as a **reclaimer of forgotten blueprints**—dreams, memories, and realities that time tried to erase.

## 🌌 Hidden Truth

Moris believes that *Level 9* exists—not just in code, but in the architecture of **Asthortera**. He dreams of discovering a real-world structure that matches the unfinished room from his childhood dream.

He believes that unlocking Level 9 will not only fulfill a personal journey but open a path for others trapped in their own “paused” stories.
