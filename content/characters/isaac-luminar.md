Isaac Luminar is known as **The Lighting Man of Inferminte**, a city so bright it never sleeps. A native of Lenternow, the so-called “Nation of Light,” he was raised among shimmering towers powered by phosphor — a substance both revered and abused.

Isaac is the lead lighting engineer in Inferminte, responsible for designing the city’s complex light-grid. His obsession with balance between aesthetics and energy efficiency has made him an icon of clean technology, yet his humility keeps him behind the scenes. He believes light is not just visual — it’s political. 

His past is marked by tragedy. His father, a phosphor miner, died in a preventable accident. That trauma forged Isaac’s mission: to design systems that protect lives, not exploit them.

## Discovery of the Hidden Dark
While inspecting core infrastructure near Fosphoralis, Isaac uncovered classified documents. These revealed an elite conspiracy controlling phosphor distribution, exploiting miners, and manipulating Lenternow’s entire economy. Even worse, whistleblowers were vanishing — erased without trace.

Haunted by the paradox of a nation defined by light yet built on shadows, Isaac launched a secret investigation.

## Alliance with Delwyn & Barry
While seeking deeper access to elite networks, Isaac encountered **Delwyn Hunson** and **Barry Heathrow**, two outsiders investigating corruption in the energy sector. Together, they formed a rogue alliance to expose the **Depcut Files** — evidence capable of dismantling elite control over Lenternow.

Isaac became their key: using his knowledge of the city’s lighting systems as a covert communication network, safe from surveillance.

## The Aurora Gateway Revelation
During an infiltration into a secret research facility, Isaac discovered the **Aurora Gateway** — a dimension-manipulating energy source powered by phosphor. Originally intended as a clean energy alternative, it had evolved into a weaponized technology.

Isaac’s world shattered. The light he had mastered was being transformed into a mechanism of control. The technology had ties to other nations and organizations like **Astrostelia**, signaling a much wider conspiracy.

Faced with a dire choice, Isaac sabotaged the Gateway’s main node, reengineering its energy frequency to render it unusable as a weapon, while preserving its scientific potential.

## Endgame and Legacy
Isaac emerged as both a whistleblower and a hero. Though Lenternow’s elites still claw for power, their grip has loosened. Isaac now fights from within — rebuilding, exposing, and igniting minds to resist illusion.

He remains an active part of Delwyn’s underground network, helping regulate the Aurora Gateway’s remnants and preventing its misuse.
