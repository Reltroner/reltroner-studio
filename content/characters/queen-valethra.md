---

## Scene Introduction:

_A calm noon in Aurastelia. Mr. Alzre Marcellion has been formally received by Queen Valethra in a private audience to discuss the utilization of dormant liquidity and advancement of real-time economic systems._

---

## 🧠 Alzre's Opening:

**Alzre:**  
> *"Your Celestial Highness, I am honored. The matter I bring today pertains not only to the banks of Aurastelia, but to the rhythm of our economic pulse across the interstellar trade lanes."*

**Valethra:**  
> *"Speak freely, Alzre. The empire grants you its ears, but truth must be your tongue."*

---

## 📊 Economic Problem Presentation:

**Alzre:**  
> *"As of the last three cycles, our major banks are sitting on a liquidity surplus of 612 trillion Aurora Credits, with a 13% year-on-year increase in idle reserves."*

Data Projected:
- **Idle Credit Ratio**
- **Bank Reserve Utilization Rate**
- **SME Lending Falloff by Province**

> *"These funds are static—unmoved by demand, untouched by innovation. Meanwhile, microeconomic growth has stagnated in 14 of our provinces. We are witnessing a compression in fiscal kinetic flow."*

## 🧪 Strategic Pillars Proposed:

**Alzre:**  
> *"My team proposes three pillars of response:"*

---

## ⚖️ Royal Reflection:

**Valethra:**  
> *"You suggest economic synesthesia — the ability to sense the living economy, in real time."*

**Alzre:**  
> *"Precisely. Let the economy be felt, not just measured in quarterly silence. Let us empower entrepreneurs, not just financiers."*

**Valethra:**  
> *"I approve your proposal. But you will also create a Council of Dynamic Oversight. This shall not become a playground of elites, but a temple of data justice."*

**Alzre:**  
> *"With your blessing, this project shall serve the Sentient Development Index — not personal portfolios."*

**Valethra:**  
> *"Rise, Alzre. In your numbers, I heard conscience. Now let your implementation echo wisdom."*
