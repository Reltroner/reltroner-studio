Evara Alena is the daughter of Kamila Alena — the founder of Henchoeway and one of the principal figures behind the spread of Nytherion influence. Despite her lineage, Evara walks a different path, one forged through observation rather than declaration.

Still a student when first introduced, Evara attends the same class as **Little Rere** (Rei Reltroner in disguise). Though unaware of his true identity, she quickly develops a quiet curiosity toward him. Her instincts are sharp, her gaze lingering just a bit longer than most — as if her soul remembers a different time.

She is not yet entangled in the major ideological wars of Asthortera, but her position as Kamila’s daughter places her at the intersection of fate and rebellion. Evara's thoughts are quiet, but her presence is always noted. She is a thread waiting to be pulled in the grand narrative.

## Hidden Nature
Evara often draws mandalas unconsciously during class — patterns later identified as **Astralis glyphs**, despite never being taught about them. This suggests she may carry a latent resonance with Astralis logic — a terrifying prospect, given her mother's origins.

Some whisper that **Kamila has deliberately kept Evara away from Henchoeway's true core**, hoping to spare her from the shadows. Others believe Kamila has left traces of her own fear and regret within Evara’s subconscious — a silent transfer of memory and restraint.

## Visual Scene — “The Soda Can Moment”
In one brief but poignant classroom moment, Little Rere drops his signature blue soda can — *Reltron Refresh*. The metallic sound echoes across the room. While others giggle, Evara doesn’t.

She slowly picks it up, brushes the dust off, and hands it back without saying a word.

Their eyes meet for a moment longer than necessary.

There are no spoken lines.
But in that silence, a spark is exchanged — as if both carry memories from a life they never lived.

From that day forward, Evara begins to sketch *not just glyphs* but fragments of cities she has never visited — some bearing a striking resemblance to Reltronepolis.

## Relationships
- **Kamila Alena:** Her mother. Their relationship is distant, yet respectful. Kamila rarely speaks of her past to Evara, but often leaves books open on specific pages — metaphors, blueprints, and poems that seem meant for Evara’s eyes only.
- **Little Rere (Rei Reltroner):** A mysterious classmate. Evara suspects he is not what he seems. He reminds her of the skies in her dreams — silent, infinite, and watching.


## Themes
- Inheritance vs Choice  
- Intuition as a form of truth  
- The silent rebellion of purity within chaos
