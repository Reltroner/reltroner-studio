## 🍁 Root Influences

### 1. **Canada Native Roots**

Phonemes and lexicons derived from indigenous languages like Inuktitut, Cree, and Mi’kmaq.

### 2. **Scout Tradition**

Terminology like "knot", "track", and "fire" exist as sacred verbs. Example:

* *Knot* → "Vaurith" (also means “bind a memory”)

### 3. **Seasonal Emotion Encoding**

Stelpadien embeds seasonal affect into vocabulary:

* **Autumn** = grief, gratitude, letting go
* **Winter** = patience, silence, memory
* **Spring** = hope, awakening
* **Summer** = generosity, abundance
