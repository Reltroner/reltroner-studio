# 🌌 Aurora Faith of Aurastelia

## 🕊️ Four Pillars of Aurora Sancta

### 1. ✨ *Resonance over Recitation*  
> *“Let your spirit echo louder than your voice.”*  
Aurora Sancta does not demand the memorization of sacred texts.  
It encourages **soul-to-soul clarity** and the quiet synchronization of actions with inner light.

### 2. 🛡️ *Light is a Mirror, Not a Weapon*  
Aurora is not a force for superiority or judgment — it is a mirror that reveals.  
No believer is permitted to use their faith to elevate or condemn.

### 3. 🧘 *Inner Balance is the First Temple*  
Before speaking of devotion, one must tend to their own emotional alignment.  
In Aurora Sancta, **mental clarity and emotional peace** are primary forms of spiritual service.

### 4. 👑 *The Queen as Living Light*  
Queen Valethra is not deified.  
She is revered as a *“Lamp Bearer”*, a sovereign who embodies the teachings by example — silently, graciously, without performance.
