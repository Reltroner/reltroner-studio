# 🕰️ Retro Heritage in Reltronland — From Liberation Era to Office Punk Dominance

---

## 1. Origins of Retro Culture in Reltronland

**Liberation Era**  
After winning the war against Depcutland, Reltronland entered an intense reconstruction phase. Technology and infrastructure were still at a *late-industrial age* level (1940–1970 retro equivalent).  

**Collective Atmosphere**  
National pride manifested in:  
- Wool suits, fedoras, long dresses, A-line skirts.  
- Jazz big-band, swing, early rock ‘n’ roll.  
- Art deco & early modernist architecture.  

Retro became the **visual identity** of the nation’s “Early Golden Age.”
