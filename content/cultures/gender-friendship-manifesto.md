# 🤝 Gender Friendship Manifesto of Asthortera

> *“We are not born to belong. We are born to connect.”*

In the sentient civilization of **Asthortera**, gender is never a boundary. While society universally recognizes **only two biological genders** — male and female — the civilization has transcended archaic labels, emotional immaturity, and feudal relationship dynamics.

---

## I. Friendship is Not a Prelude to Romance

- Hugging, smiling, caring, or deep emotional presence **does not imply romantic tension**.
- **Male-female friendship is normalized**, dignified, and celebrated without suspicion or labeling.
- No party is expected to “confess,” “define the relationship,” or “retreat in awkwardness.”

> *“The bond exists. It doesn't need to be branded.”*

---

## II. Affection is a Right, Not a Contract

- Emotional intimacy is **not owned** by romance.
- Sentient beings of Asthortera understand **shared moments** of silence, touch, and sincerity are a **gift**, not a gateway.

---

## III. Gender is Unchosen. Respect is Mandatory.

- You do not choose your gender at birth.
- Thus, no individual should be **judged, limited, or suspected** because of their gender in friendship.
- There is **no stigma**, no “cringe,” and no pressure to behave according to drama tropes.

> *“To be born male or female is chance. But to be kind and clear — that’s choice.”*

---

## IV. Immaturity Is Not Entertainment

- Asthorteran culture rejects the immaturity seen in many other worlds:
  - Overreacting at hugs
  - Turning every compliment into a joke
  - Gossiping about “chemistry”
- Friendship here is **rooted in shared values, goals, and trust**, not hormonal assumptions.

---

## V. We Do Not Sexualize Presence

- The **presence** of someone — their body, voice, attention — is **not a source of entitlement**.
- Physical closeness is respected. Not sensationalized.
- **There is no “will they/won’t they” narrative obsession.** There is only “are they present with grace?”

## Closing Quote:
> *“In Asthortera, we grow beyond the walls others built for us. And in that open sky, we meet — not as man or woman — but as sentient beings, worthy of knowing, worthy of sharing, worthy of nothing but the moment itself.”*
