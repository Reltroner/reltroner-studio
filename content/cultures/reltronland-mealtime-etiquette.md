## 🥢 Do Not Disturb While Nourishing

In Reltronland, eating is not merely a biological process. It is considered an essential period of **mental restoration**, **cellular focus**, and **neuro-spiritual recalibration**. Thus, interrupting someone with **non-urgent small talk during meals** is considered **impolite and ethically discouraged**.

> "Energy consumed in silence is clarity. Energy disrupted becomes noise."

---

## 🧠 Philosophical Foundations

* Meals = **Code Fuel** for cognitive clarity.
* During digestion, the sentient body shifts into **repair and recalibration mode**.
* Unnecessary conversation = **“Noise Injection”** — disrupts focus, digestion, and sentient harmony.
