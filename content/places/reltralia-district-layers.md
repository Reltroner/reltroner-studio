# 🏙️ The District Layers of Reltralia

**Reltralia** is not merely the capital of Reltronland — it is the living embodiment of identity itself.  
Each district is constructed as a layer of existential, legal, and spiritual protection for the nation's consciousness and its creator's vision.

---

## 🔴 CORE DISTRICT: **Reltroner**

- **Purpose:** The original and central manifestation of the nation's identity and its creator.
- **Domain Ownership:** reltroner.com
- **Active Projects:** Reltroner Studio, The Abyss of Comfort, The Freezone Code
- **State:** **Primary.** Official public-facing identity.
- **Notes:** If undisturbed, all worldbuilding remains centralized here.

---

## 🟠 PLAN B DISTRICT: **Reltrorer**

- **Purpose:** Emergency rebrand identity. A spiritual echo in case "Reltroner" is compromised legally or commercially.
- **Conceptual Role:** Represents the phoenix of the original — reborn through intentional narrative shift.
- **District Trait:** Architecturally minimalist, shield-symbol infrastructure.
- **State:** **Dormant.** Activated only if core identity is legally threatened.

---

## 🟢 PLAN C DISTRICT: **Reltrorel**

- **Purpose:** Metaphysical fallback. Pure, untouched territory created as the last line of sanctuary.
- **Role in Lore:** A hidden zone known only to the original creator and a few chosen sentients. Known as *"The Sanctum of Identity."*
- **Function:** Can absorb and re-manifest entire identity frameworks if Reltroner and Reltrorer are both lost.
- **State:** **Locked.** Existentially protected, inaccessible unless triggered through spiritual failsafe protocols.
