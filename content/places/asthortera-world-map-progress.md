# 🗺️ Asthortera World Map — Development Progress Overview

This document presents the **current version** of the world map of **Asthortera**, the primary planetary setting of the Reltroner Studio Universe. It is a visual work-in-progress intended to help track the growth of regions, geopolitics, cultural zones, and narrative arcs across the world.
