## ✈️ RAIA — Reltronepolis Aeropolis International Airport

> _“To leave the planet is to carry the clarity of Reltronland into the stars.”_  
> — Astralis Aerospace Charter

---

### 📍 Location & Function
RAIA is located **at the northeastern edge of the border between Reltronepolis Province and Leastroper Province**, seamlessly linked by the **Airport Rail Link (ARL)** from Reltronepolis Central Station.

RAIA is the **primary planetary and interstellar mobility hub** for Reltronland, handling:
- **Intercontinental flights** across Asthortera
- **Orbital shuttles** to satellite cities and space elevators
- **Interstellar launches** to allied planets like Depeisit, Cosmeilia, and Cistheta

---

### 🛫 Terminal System
1. **T1–T900** — Asthorteran continent-to-continent flights
2. **T901–T1800** — Interplanetary transit (Depeisit, Cistheta, Cosmeilia)
3. **T1801–T2700** — Full interstellar routes and heavy orbital operations
4. **T-R Core** — Diplomatic, royal, and spiritual class protocols
5. **T2701–T2844** — Private elite aerospace & technocratic deployments

---

### 🚉 Connectivity
- Direct ARL connection to **Reltronepolis Central Station** 
- Internal **Autonomous SkyTram Network** within RAIA campus
- Hyperloop connector to **East RAIA Cargo Port**

---

### 🧠 Technological Features
- **Sentient Flight Management AI** — Harmonizes energy allocation, biosign detection, and trajectory regulation
- **Clarity Gate ID System** — Multi-dimensional ID verification for citizens, migrants, and diplomats
- **Aurora Departure Ring** — Emotional light modulation dome for pre-launch focus and balance

---

### 🌌 Symbolism & Legacy
RAIA is not just an airport — it is the physical extension of **Reltronland’s planetary philosophy** into the galaxy. Every gate is aligned with the Astralis grid and serves as an **energetic outflow node** for cross-world clarity missions.

> _“To pass through RAIA is to cross not just space, but intent.”_
