## ✈️ Whitepaper: Reltronepolis Aeropolis International Airport (RAIA)

## 📘 Executive Summary

Reltronepolis Aeropolis International Airport (RAIA) is the largest intermodal and interstellar airport on the planet Asthortera. It is the logistical core of Reltronland’s global and galactic connectivity, built to accommodate the transportation needs of a Kardashev Type I.9 civilization. Designed for scalability, redundancy, and spiritual-technical harmony, RAIA is a model for future planetary spaceports.

---

## 🌐 Context & Purpose

RAIA was established as the primary node for intercontinental, orbital, and interstellar flight. As Asthortera’s sentient population surpasses 4.4 trillion and Reltronland alone houses 855 billion inhabitants, high-density, high-frequency, and high-precision travel systems became imperative.
