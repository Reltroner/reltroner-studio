# 🛰️ RAIA Airport Quarantine Towers — Airborne Clarity Node of Reltronland

An airborne fortress above Reltronepolis, integrating RAIA's interstellar gateway with the Clarity Quarantine Network to intercept and neutralize Nytherion Abyss influence before it reaches the city.

> *"Intercept in the skies, purify before landing."*

---

## 📍 Overview

The **RAIA Airport Quarantine Towers** are an **airgrid-suspended clarity fortress** embedded within the **Reltronepolis Aeropolis International Airport** complex.  
Their primary role: **intercept, isolate, and cleanse** sentients flagged for Nytherion Abyss or Henchoeway exposure *before* they step onto Reltronland’s 100% urban surface.

By integrating **planetary-scale aerospace logistics** with **high-altitude clarity protocols**, RAIA ensures that no incoming traveler can bypass Reltronland’s Astralis-aligned mental security grid.

---

## 🧭 Core Quarantine Objectives

1. **Aerial Containment** — Capture and transport high-risk individuals from incoming flights within minutes of atmospheric entry.
2. **Pre-Landing Neutralization** — Apply Red Pill resonance recalibration before the subject disembarks.
3. **Cognitive Reconstruction** — Conduct altitude-adaptive therapy for mental resilience.
4. **Verification Before Entry** — Certify complete mental stability prior to granting planetary clearance.

---

## 🏗️ Architectural Features

- **Suspended Isolation Rings** — Glass-domed circular quarantine decks orbiting the RAIA tower core.
- **Dimensional Distortion Filters** — Dissipate incoming Abyssal energy before it reaches terminal gates.
