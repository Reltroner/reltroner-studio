## ✨ Passenger Experience Journey

**Gate T2332 → Emotional Pod → Time Corridor → Interstellar Boarding**

Passengers departing from interstellar terminals (T1801–T2700) begin their journey through the **Zero-Wait Scan Gate**. At Gate **T2332**, travelers are welcomed into **Emotion-Aware Boarding Pods** — serene ambient capsules that harmonize neural frequency and reduce long-haul anxiety.

Once emotionally stabilized, passengers walk through the **Spatial-Time Compression Corridor**, where the physical sensation of time passing is accelerated — shortening the walk without sacrificing comfort.

The corridor ends in a fully automated **Ship Boarding Dock**, where the Reltronic Mobility Overseer (RMO) guides passengers to their designated cabin in real-time.

> *“No rush, no friction — only alignment.”*

---

## 🔋 Energy Architecture

* **Antimatter Core Grid** for base power
* **Aurora Streamlining Conduit** for emotional balance + kinetic modulation
* **Orbital Solar-Reflector Satellites** feeding **Photon Absorption Towers**

This hybrid system ensures a **non-stop power loop**, balancing physical performance and emotional equilibrium of personnel and passengers.
