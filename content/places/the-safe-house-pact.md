## 👣 Dialogue Highlights (Mobile Friendly Format)

**Raina:**  
*"Last time we used this safe house, Hendry... it was to launch SkyZone prototype."*

**Hendry:**  
*"This time, we're not testing tech.  
We're testing consciousness."*

**Wayne (hands over a coded sheet):**  
*"This isn't just data corruption.  
It's an ideological virus, written in spiritual code.  
Gandia is weaponizing economic logic."*

**Raina (quiet, haunted):**  
*"This code... I saw it in my father's notebook.  
He told me, 'If the world wraps pain in legality, crack the code — then run.'"*

**Hendry:**  
*"This isn't about exposing a traitor.  
It's about protecting the meaning of responsibility.  
If we lose, even the word ‘effort’ will rot."*

## 🧭 The Pact Ritual

Hendry places a small **Astralis prism** on a broken table.  
He looks at Raina and Wayne.

> *"Place something that represents your truth...  
if you're ready to protect what work truly means."*

- Wayne sets down his first Skytrone name badge.  
- Raina offers a fragment of her father’s notebook.  
- Hendry closes his eyes and touches the prism.

## ✨ Conclusion

From this forgotten shelter, beneath broken stars and silent waters...  
**a vow was made.**  
Not as employees,  
but as sentient beings defending clarity against the unseen fog.

We serve the meaning it was born to protect.”*
