### 🧠 Why Pasgerflit Became the Aviation Capital of Asthortera

Since early childhood, the founder of Asthortera’s (Reltroner Studio) worldbuilding (age 3) developed an intense love for aviation—imagining aircraft larger than the planet itself. From that vision, **Pasgerflit** was born as a tribute to the sky: a nation where aviation defines identity, economy, and philosophy.

- **Capital City:** **Aviashenwelt** — administrative and aerospace core
- **Major Cities:**
  - **Skyportalis** — aircraft tech and airline R&D hub
  - **Runwayria** — tourism and transit megacenter
- **Currency:** **$PAS**
- **Nicknames:** *World of Endless Airports*, *Sky Nation of Asthortera*

### ✈️ Pasgerflit’s Aeronautical Economy
- **Core Sectors:**
  - Aviation Industry (civilian, military, and intercontinental craft)
  - Airline Management & Logistics
  - Airport Tech Innovation (security, passenger systems)
  - Transit Tourism (urban stopover experience design)
  - Aviation Education (flight schools, engineering, airspace policy)

> _Economic Motto: "Connecting Horizons, Empowering Journeys."_

### 🧠 Pasgerflit’s SDI Advantage

While **Pasgerflit’s SDI (0.949)** is slightly lower than Reltronland (0.984) or Depcutland (0.983), **its soul and identity revolve entirely around aviation**. The aviation industry is not just an economic pillar—it is the **core strength, spiritual drive, and lifeblood of the Pasgerflitian civilization.**

Pasgerflit defines itself not by how much it governs, but **how far it connects the world.**
- **SDI: 0.949**  
Driven by:
- Aviation excellence  
- Transit innovation  
- High ethical infrastructure design  
- Inclusivity & clarity in public transport culture

## 🚀 Civilian Ship Landing Specifications – PAIA

## ✈️ Runway Compatibility Chart

This document outlines the standard dimensional compatibility and landing status of civilian interstellar ships within the PAIA (Pasgerflit Aeropolis International Airport) spaceport. All specifications below are calculated based on the standard PAIA runway dimensions:

* **Runway Size:** 125 meters (width) × 13,200 meters (length)

---

## 📋 Ship Profiles and Landing Clearance

### 1. **Civilian Starliner**

![civilian-starliner](/images/civilian-starliner.webp)

* **Length:** 140 meters
* **Width:** 60 meters
* **Landing Status:** ✅ **Clear and Unrestricted**
* **Description:** A sleek, high-speed passenger transport designed for interplanetary tourism and daily executive shuttle services across Asthortera. Optimized for low-gravity approach, minimal turbulence footprint, and horizontal descent protocols.

---

### 2. **Interstellar Freighter**

![interstellar-freighter](/images/interstellar-freighter.webp)

* **Length:** 200 meters
* **Width:** 90 meters
* **Landing Status:** ✅ **Approved with Margins**
* **Description:** A heavy-haul cargo vessel equipped for deep-space logistics and colony provisioning. Its adaptive landing struts and modular hold segments allow precise touchdown on PAIA's extended high-tolerance aprons.

---

### 3. **Diplomatic Ark Shuttle**

![diplomatic-ark-shuttle](/images/diplomatic-ark-shuttle.webp)

* **Length:** 300 meters
* **Width:** 110 meters
* **Landing Status:** ✅ **Cleared — Full Manual Margin Protocols Applied**
* **Description:** A high-profile transport shuttle reserved for planetary alliances, inter-civilization diplomacy, and ceremonial missions. Equipped with deep stabilizer arrays and reinforced radiant shielding. Maneuvered under dual-AI and pilot override protocols.

---

## 📐 Clearance Safety Notes

* All above ships operate **well within PAIA runway dimensions**, including lateral buffer zones.
* Emergency lateral deployables are in place for ships with wingspans nearing the 125-meter threshold.
* Longitudinal length (13,200m) is suitable for even high-inertia launch or low-thrust landing maneuvers.
