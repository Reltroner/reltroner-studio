# 🏛️ Neiput Treaty Dialogue — *A Diplomatic Scene in Four Movements*

## 📜 Setting:

**Location:** Neiput Border, twilight hour. Lentern glow on marble.
**Characters:** Reltronball & Depcutball.
**Context:** Reenactment of one of many diplomatic reconciliations after the Battle of Troneiput.

---

## 🎭 Scene I: The Ledger of Conflict

**Depcutball** (sifting through aged parchment):
📖 *“Clause 3, Subsection 14 — records indicate you fired first at Rathroper, 1048 BAC.”*

**Reltronball** (monotone):
📂 *“Correction. We intercepted a manifest violating the Sentient Clarity Zone. Chaos masked as commerce is no different from invasion.”*

**Depcutball** (cold):
📚 *“It was parchment. Not plutonium.”*

**Reltronball** (unmoved):
💢 *“Intent outlasts matter. And your Cutneiput clause? Weaponized nostalgia.”*

---

## 🎭 Scene II: Heritage in Dispute

**Depcutball** (tracing a lentern shadow on the treaty table):
🪶 *“We remember to protect the past. You erase to secure the future.”*

**Reltronball** (with steel precision):
🧠 *“We remove what no longer serves the clarity of now.”*

**Depcutball:**
📄 *“Peace cannot be forged on forgetting.”*

**Reltronball:**
🧾 *“Then we archive the fracture. Not the infection.”*

---

## 🎭 Scene III: The Walk to the Arch

**(Both balls step toward the ceremonial midline. Reltronball’s hologram badge glows. Depcutball’s quill twitches with inklight.)**

**Reltronball:**
🧱 *“We will never walk the same path.”*

**Depcutball:**
📖 *“But we always meet at the same gate.”*

---

## 🎭 Scene IV: Ritual of Still Endurance

**(They place a shared document on the altar of Neiput — stone, glass, and oath.)**

🗒️ *“📜 Troncut Treaty — Still in Effect.”*

> *“Two ideologies. One threshold. Clarity and heritage do not cancel. They codify.”*
> — Border Inscription, Troneiput Archway

---

## 🕊️ Historical Note

The Neiput Dialogue is reenacted every 5 cycles in Troneiput & Cutneiput.
Despite ancient conflict, it remains the most studied diplomatic ritual in Asthortera.
