# 💎 Astralis Capital Doctrine

## I. Core Purpose

The **Astralis Capital Doctrine** is the highest moral-economic framework of Reltronland.
It redefines capital not as accumulation of wealth, but as **amplification of clarity**.

> “Capital is not what you store. It’s what you refine, share, and evolve.”

---

## II. Foundational Tenets

### 🔺 1. **Clarity Over Greed**

* Economic actions must elevate sentient development, not personal indulgence.

### 🔺 2. **Stewardship Over Ownership**

* Wealth is temporarily held, permanently accountable.

### 🔺 3. **Resonance Over Scarcity**

* Capital flows where sentient need resonates — not where scarcity is manipulated.

### 🔺 4. **Circulation Over Hoarding**

* Stagnant assets are taxed by time. Movement is rewarded.

### 🔺 5. **Transparency Over Performance**

* Worth is measured by visible contribution, not hidden metrics.

---

## III. Application Domains

### 🧾 **Public Budgeting**  
Funds are not allocated by politics, but by **SDI-pressure metrics**.  
The **Fiscal Grid** responds to demographic data and sends real-time alignment signals to redirect state spending.

---

### 📈 **Stock Market (RXS)**  
In the **RXS 500**, profit is **secondary to purpose**.  
All listed entities must pass **Clarity Audits** to remain eligible.  
Speculation without sentient contribution = automatic disqualification.

---

### 🪙 **Personal Wealth**  
- **No income tax** — contribution is encouraged, not punished.  
- But: **Time-tax on dormant capital**.  
  Hoarding with no intention = entropy = penalty.

---

### 🏢 **Enterprise Models**  
All companies must show that their **impact on SDI** is measurable.  
Revenue alone is not value.  
**Value = uplift × transparency × clarity resonance**.

---

## IV. Time-Based Capital Taxation

To prevent hoarding and economic decay:

* Capital left inactive for > 400 days is auto-redistributed
* Redistribution targets: SDI-negative zones, civic uplift programs
* Exception only for legacy archive funds with clarity purpose tags

---

## V. Forbidden Practices

* Speculative derivatives
* Short-selling designed to induce fear
* Profit models dependent on attention addiction
* Algorithmic manipulation of citizen behavior

> “If your model thrives on illusion — you have no right to hold capital in Reltronland.”

---

## VI. Astralis-Informed Economic Agents

Every major system (RXS, Fiscal Grid, HRM Payroll, SDI Uplift Engine) is monitored by:

* **Clarity Watchdogs**: AI+Human hybrid ethics review teams
* **Astralis Simulators**: Forecast emotional-economic impact before deployment
* **Purpose Auditors**: Manual review of high-capital decisions based on resonance reports

---

## VII. Philosophical Summary

* Money = *Energy*
* Profit = *Signal of Useful Structure*
* Tax = *Calibration Mechanism, Not Punishment*
* Wealth = *Obligation to Circulate Clarity*

---

## Final Doctrine

> “You do not own capital. You are tested by it.”

In Reltronland, economics is not the system.
**Clarity is the system. Capital is merely one of its instruments.**

*Let Astralis guide every transaction.*
