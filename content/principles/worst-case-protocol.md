# ⚠️ Worst-Case Survival Protocol

> "Even if I'm starving, I will never go into debt."

This is my emergency fallback plan when all expectations collapse and the world becomes silent.

---

## 🔻 Step-by-Step Contingency Plan

### 1. **3 Months Emergency Fund Left**
If I still haven't found any clients:
- I will search for **local Indonesian clients**, either through online platforms or **community forums** within my current city or area of residence.
- My main mission: secure income to stay afloat.

---

### 2. **2 Months Emergency Fund Left**
If local clients also fail:
- I will **take any available work**, including **manual labor or online gigs** (e.g. motorcycle courier, delivery, freelance jobs).
- Objective: **save up at least 6 months' worth of emergency funds**, then **quit** to return building my vision.

---

### 3. **1 Month Emergency Fund Left**
If still no breakthrough:
- I will seek **temporary help from local mosques or neighbors**.  
- I’ll use my ID card (still showing Islam) to access help, purely for survival.  
- Goal: **launch a small microbusiness (UMKM)** to gain autonomy again.

---

### 4. **Emergency Fund = 0**
If I have no income, no savings, and no support:
- I **will continue walking forward**, even if I’m physically starving or close to collapse.
- But under no circumstance will I **ever borrow money** or go into debt.

---

## 🤝 After Recovery

If I'm able to stand again thanks to:
- Neighbors
- Community support
- Mosques or random strangers

Then I will:
- **Return the favor**, repay the help even if it wasn’t a formal debt.
- **Rebuild my life** until I can maintain **6 months of emergency funds**.
- **Resume my master plans**: building ERP, IT systems, and expanding the Reltroner World.
