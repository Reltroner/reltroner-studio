# 📖 Reltronland Knowledge Architecture

## I. Purpose

In Reltronland, knowledge is not stored — it is **safeguarded**.
Every byte, every scroll, and every `.md` file must serve the uplift of clarity.

> “What we archive defines what we become.”

---

## II. Core Institutions

### 🏛️ 1. **The Reltronian Civic Library Network (RCLN)**

* Fully integrated public library grid
* Specialized silence chambers for reflective study
* Multi-format: scroll, digital, projection, simulation

### 🌐 2. **Digital Clarity Archive (DCA)**

* Decentralized `.md` file repository of:

  * Factional documents
  * Personal manifestos
  * Clarity indexes
* Accessible via public API and mirror nodes

### 🧠 3. **The Mind Mirror Terminal**

* Interactive holographic access points
* Queries filtered through SDI logic and resonance context
* Every citizen has a personalized mirror log

---

## III. Metadata Discipline

* All entries are tagged by:

  * Clarity Impact Category (CIC)
  * Emotional Weight Index (EWI)
  * SDI Alignment Score
* Entries without clarity value are archived in **Dormant Memory Layer** until reviewed

---

## IV. Preservation & Authorship

* Each contributor becomes a **Knowledge Custodian**
* Content must include:

  * Author’s resonance intent
  * Astralis Ethic Declaration
  * Digital fingerprint (non-anonymous clarity trace)

> “In Reltronland, knowledge without source is treated as illusion.”
