# 📚 Reltronland Education Framework

## I. Core Vision

Education in Reltronland is not memorization — it is **sentient awakening**.
It exists to:

* Elevate SDI from childhood to legacy
* Prevent illusion-based indoctrination
* Equip every citizen with self-calibration tools

> “We do not teach for exams. We teach for evolution.”

### 🛠️ 4. **Hands-on Sovereign Labs**

* Interdisciplinary clarity studios

### 🪞 5. **Reflection Rituals**
