# 📜 Humanoid Standard Doctrine — Universality of Sentient Form

*"Form may differ in aura, age, or origin, but the essence of sentience remains humanoid."*  
— Reltroner Studio Canon, Year 967 BAC

---

## 📍 Overview
The **Humanoid Standard Doctrine (HSD)** is the foundational principle of **Asthortera’s sentient biology**.  
It declares that all sentient biological species — whether **Reltronian humans, Hybrids, or the Cosmeilia Cosmic Race** — share a **unified humanoid form**.  

Unlike universes filled with exotic alien morphologies, Asthortera chose *clarity of form* to ensure **universality of language, culture, and consciousness**.  

---

## 🧬 Key Principles of HSD

- **Humanoid Universality**  
  Every sentient biological being in Asthortera retains a humanoid structure: two arms, two legs, facial expressions, and voice.  

- **Variation by Essence, not by Shape**  
  Distinctions between species manifest not in body structure, but in **aura, spiritual capacity, longevity, and cultural origin**.  

- **Post-Globalization Civilization**  
  In Asthortera, migration between nations is as seamless as moving between provinces on Earth. Thus, a unified biological standard removes barriers in communication and coexistence.

## 🔹 Classification under HSD

1. **Humans (Reltronian, Depcutian, Pencilian, etc.)**  
   - Physically indistinguishable from Earth humans, often enhanced by meritocratic lifestyle.  
   - Dominant by population.  

2. **Hybrids**  
   - Born of human and non-human sentient lineage (e.g., Human + Cosmeilia).  
   - Appear human but exhibit **subtle cosmic traits**: glowing eyes, ethereal hair, extended lifespans.  

3. **Cosmeilia Cosmic Race**  
   - Ageless humanoids with radiant silver hair, violet eyes, and innate cosmic powers.  
   - Spiritually influential, culturally foundational.  

4. **Minor Sentient Variants (e.g., Piksyl)**  
   - Fairy-like but humanoid in their core structure.  
   - Spread *Cosmic Cute Culture* across Asthortera.

## 🌌 Cultural & Philosophical Impact

- **Accessibility for All Audiences**  
  By keeping species humanoid, Asthortera remains logically digestible to both scientific and casual minds.  
- **Focus on Philosophy, not Biology**  
  The narrative centers on **spirituality, meritocracy, and existential conflict** instead of alien biophysics.  
- **Archetypal Resonance**  
  Characters echo familiar archetypes (Rosalina, Zelda, Gandalf, Dumbledore) while embodying Asthortera’s own philosophy of **Astralis vs Abyss**.  

---

## ⚖️ Closing Statement
The **Humanoid Standard Doctrine** ensures that Asthortera’s vast diversity of civilizations and species is united by a single truth:  
👉 *Sentience in Asthortera is always expressed through the humanoid form.*  

This doctrine is what makes Asthortera not only **globalized**, but also **universally relatable** across imagination, philosophy, and science.
