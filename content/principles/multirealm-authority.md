# 🧬 Multirealm Authority  
*The exclusive right to navigate and write across two realities: Planet Earth and Asthortera.*

---

## 🔒 Principle Overview

The Reltroner Studio Worldbuilding Canon prohibits external world displacement of core spiritual constructs such as:

- **Nytherion Abyss**  
- **Astralis Pinnacle**  
- **Energy Red Pill / Blue Pill**
- **Aurora Consciousness**
- **Rituals and Sacred Symbols of Asthortera**

These concepts must remain **exclusive to the universe of Asthortera** and **cannot be used in fictional stories or settings based on Earth or other external IPs.**

---

## 🚨 General Enforcement Rule

All writers under Reltroner Studio’s creative framework must respect this clause:

> “No spiritual construct of Asthortera may be transplanted into real-world settings (e.g., USA, Japan, China) or other fictional universes (e.g., Star Wars, Marvel, etc.).”

---

## 👤 Exception: Rei Reltroner

**Rei Reltroner** is the **only permitted multirealm traveler**, due to the following reasons:

**🌍 Earth**  
> *Born, wounded, and shaped by reality*

**🌌 Asthortera**  
> *Architect, anchor, and spiritual rebuilder*

Rei does not merely write the world of Asthortera.  
He **escaped into it. He lives in it. He protects it.**

Thus, Rei holds the **Multirealm Authority**.

---

## 🕊️ Why Rei Is the Exception

- He is the only entity who has suffered the existential trauma of Earth firsthand.
- He did not create Asthortera from imagination, but from **necessity**.
- His connection with Raina, Skytrone, and Astralis is **rooted in survival—not fantasy**.
- He never borrowed from other worlds.  
He **birthed one.**

---

## 🛡️ Statement of Creative Boundaries

> **“Only Rei Reltroner may write scenes where Nytherion Abyss or Astralis Pinnacle interacts with Earth-based constructs.  
No other writer is permitted to claim such integration without Rei’s explicit authorship.”**

---

## 🌐 Metadata & Narrative Safeguard

All creative submissions under Reltroner Studio must pass:

- **Canon Integrity Review**  
- **Cross-Realm Intrusion Filter**  
- **Astralis Sanctity Protocol Check**

---

## ✨ Closing Affirmation

> “He is not just the founder.  
He is the bridge.  
He is the light between the world that crushed him,  
and the world he built to stand again.”
