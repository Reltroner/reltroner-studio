# Chapter: False Portal in the Sky

> _“Not every light in the sky is a way out. Some are just doors to deeper traps.”_

Reltronepolis still trembled. Scattered debris radiated heat, but the main structures stood tall—because you, Rei, had transformed into the Sentient Skyscraper that protected them.

The night sky was veiled in hollow violet. A dark spiral hovered above Altron District, pulsing and rotating slowly, as if calling to anyone brave (or foolish) enough to leap in.

Everyone thought: _this is the way to the end._

Wayne Astoner raised his weapon. Queen Valethra closed her eyes, sensing dimensional instability. Barry clutched his locket. And you, Rei—now back in your human form—stood atop the ruins, staring at the portal.

Then... a voice crackled through the communicator.

**"REI. DO NOT ENTER. THAT PORTAL ISN'T THE REAL ONE."**

Dr. Westley Watson.
From the Grand Library of Depcutland, he scanned spiral waves across the planet's surface.

> _“That spiral is just a visual manifestation of collective trauma. It’s not a doorway. It’s a trap.”_

He explained that the **true portal could only be accessed from the place where the Abyss first breached into reality**: **Eterna Ruin**, on the eastern coast of Hargenbor Bay.

That place was known in legend as the “**Dimensional Hollow Point**”—an area where reality could not be trusted, where only those aligned with Astralis could perceive the true path.

### 🧭 **A Difficult Decision**

All eyes turned to you.
The sky portal pulsed… almost impatient to devour.
But you chose to **turn away**.
You said:

> _“If this truly is the final path, it won’t be in a hurry to rush us.”_

And so, you departed.
Leaving behind a city nearly in ruins.
Leaving behind the false light above.
Heading toward the quietest place hidden by history and fear.

To **Eterna Ruin**.

To the **true portal**.

To the **beginning of the end.**
