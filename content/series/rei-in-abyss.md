# Rei in Abyss

**A novel by Reltroner Studio**

Rei in Abyss is a psychological and spiritual-fiction novel about a young man who loses almost everything—his academic status, his self-worth, his parents' trust, and 95% of his speculative trading assets. At the edge of collapse, he awakens in a surreal space called **Nytherion Abyss**, where illusions of comfort, false success, and emotional paralysis try to hold him forever.

As Rei explores this abyss, he encounters deceptive simulations: hotel rooms filled with validation, infinite social feeds that numb the will to act, memories manipulated into perfect scenarios that never happened, and the haunting figure of **Kamila**, who offers rest in exchange for surrendering his will.

But instead of giving in, Rei climbs.

He rejects perfection.
He breaks the mirror.
He walks away from the spiral.

He emerges from the abyss not to return to his old life—but to build something new: **Reltroner.com**. A startup not born from success, but forged in the fire of failure. A website that becomes a digital sanctuary for others who are also lost, uncertain, or broken. It grows from one man’s rebellion into a quiet movement.

In his Builders’ Room, people don’t compete—they create.
They don’t hide scars—they write from them.

And even Kamila, the voice of the abyss, returns only to whisper.
But Rei does not belong to her anymore.

This is not a story of applause.
This is not a story of winning.

**This is a story of surviving. Creating. And lighting the dark from within.**
