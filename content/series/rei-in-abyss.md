## Logline
After losing his academic standing, personal identity, and 95% of his assets in speculative trading, Rei wakes up not in his room‚Äîbut in a dimension of false comfort known as the Nytherion Abyss. To escape, he must confront illusions, abandon perfection, and rebuild his life from nothing.

## Synopsis
*Rei in Abyss* follows the story of Rei, a young man who has just experienced the complete breakdown of his academic and personal life. Dropped from university and financially ruined by speculative trading losses, he wakes up in a surreal dimension that resembles a luxurious hotel. But beneath the surface lies something far more sinister ‚Äî a digital-psychological prison of manipulated comfort and distraction known as Nytherion Abyss.

As Rei navigates surreal hallways, memory loops, deceptive encouragement, and personified temptations, he begins to realize that this world is not his salvation ‚Äî it's his sedation.
