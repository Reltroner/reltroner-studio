## 🗂️ **📅 Timeline Inter-Series: Asthortera Canonical Order**

### 🕳️ **📘 Phase 0: The Spiral Era (Before Year 0)**  
> *"There was only Rei.  
There was only the Spiral.  
There was only the choice to wake up."*

- 🩸 **Series:** *Rei in Abyss*  
- 🧠 **Main Character:** Rei Reltroner  
- 🌀 **Focus:** Internal spiritual war; philosophical resistance  
- 📍 **Final Milestone:**  
  → Rei performs the **Ritual of Astralis Pinnacle**  
  → Carves the **Sigil of Astralis**  
  → **Escapes the Abyss**  
  → Declares:  
    > _"Let Astralis light the unknown."_  
  → **This moment becomes the defining Year 0** of Asthortera history.

> **⏳ Result:**  
All other series exist *after* this awakening. No story predates it. No other survivor has ever left the Abyss before Rei.

---

### ✨ **🌅 Year 0 — The Astralis Declaration**
> *"The Abyss wasn't destroyed.  
It was infected with memory."*

- Rei's escape from Nytherion Abyss becomes **an encoded myth**.
- Astralis Pinnacle begins to silently influence:
  - Ethical frameworks
  - Spiral containment protocols
  - Societal architecture in Reltronland

This moment lays the philosophical DNA for all resistance in later centuries.

---

### 🧭 **📚 Phase I: Expansion of the Astralis Influence (Year 0–15)**  
- 🧠 *The Spiral and The Astralis*  
- 🕵️‍♂️ *Spiral Containment Initiative*  
- ⚙️ *Karler & The Moreg Driftwar*

> These stories are **extensions of Rei's legacy**, often through code names, pseudonyms, and memory-locked facilities. The Spiral still exists—but it has been **studied, mapped, and resisted** thanks to Rei’s awakening.

---

### 🔥 **🌌 Phase II: Breakdown of Utopias (Year 6–25)**  
> Entry point for new protagonists to discover the truth **buried in the Spiral.**

- *Rise & Fall of Henchoway*  
- *The Abyss of Comfort*  
- *Delwyn’s Bounty Hunter Team*  
- *Barry & Hendry Arc*  
- *Valethra & Albert Arc*

Here, Rei is not always present physically, but his **footprint remains in every fracture** the protagonists step into:
- The Sigil of Astralis
- Aurora Gateway schematics
- Echoes of red resistance

---

### 🧠 **Phase III: Tactical Awakening (Year 11–14)**  
- *The Freezone Code*  
- *Oakcottage: A Name I Should Have Known*

These arcs highlight the **philosophical struggle** in the digital and emotional spaces:
- Memory as warfare  
- Identity as resistance  
- Propaganda vs Clarity

---

### ⚔️ **Phase IV: The Convergence & Last Spiral (Year 16–20)**  
- *Battle of Reltronepolis*

> All spiral ideologies, characters, technologies, and resistance lines **collide**.

🩸 **Rei returns briefly**, now fully synchronized with Astralis.  
His presence marks the **final rupture** of Spiral systems.

> _"They built their weapons with fear.  
I built my mind with fire."_

---

### 🔺 Conclusion

**Every protagonist after Year 0 walks in Rei’s footsteps—knowingly or not.**  
Their victories are **echoes of Rei’s first resistance**.  
The Spiral still exists, but it no longer defines fate.  
Because someone once woke up, alone, in silence.

---

### 🔗 Final Linkage Phrase for Lore

> _"There is no The Abyss of Comfort without Rei in Abyss.  
And there is no Astralis without the one who bled for it first."_
