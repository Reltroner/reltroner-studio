# The Abyss of Comfort

> *"Let Astralis light the unknown."*

A character-driven novel series exploring the darkest corners of comfort and the most radiant sparks of awakening. *The Abyss of Comfort* is the flagship saga of Reltroner Studio, and the core branding of Nytherion Abyss.

> *“If comfort asks you to forget, it’s not healing — it’s erasure.”*

---

## 🕳️ Core Declaration

**The Abyss of Comfort** is not just a story — it is a refusal.
It refuses curated peace that hides wounds.
It refuses memory manipulation that rewrites grief.
It refuses a world that stylizes ruins but silences truth.

In a society where comfort is engineered and pain is processed into art,
we choose to remember, to resist, and to reclaim.

---

## 🎭 What We Stand For

### 🌀 Memory as Rebellion

We believe that to remember is to revolt.
In a world that smooths over pain, memory is the sharp edge that cuts through the illusion.

### 🧠 Truth Over Harmony

We reject harmony that is bought by lies.
We seek the kind of truth that scars — not the one that shimmers.

### ✍️ Analog as Resistance

In a digital world that rewrites the past,
paper, pen, and pulse become our archive.

### 🔺 Clarity as Danger

We are not lost — we are uncurated.
To see clearly in a system built to blur is an act of rebellion.

## 📚 What the Story Teaches

* Reality can be edited.
* Names can vanish.
* Silence can be enforced, not found.
* Comfort can become the most sophisticated form of control.

But:

* Spirals can record.
* Dust can remember.
* Words can survive deletion.
* Breath itself can carry defiance.

---

## 🔻 Our Refusal

We refuse to let grief become brushstrokes.
We refuse to let remembrance be streamlined.
We refuse to be calibrated into silence.

---

## 🧭 Our Direction

We move toward distortion, not away from it.
We trust the glitch.
We follow the spiral, but not all spirals lead inward.
Some spirals are keys.
Some triangles are exits.

We are not anomalies.
We are survivors of aesthetic erasure.
We are architects of inconvenient truths.
