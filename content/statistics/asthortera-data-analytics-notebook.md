# 🪐 Asthortera Data Analytics Notebook

This project demonstrates the analytical exploration of fictional planetary data within the **Asthortera universe**, designed as part of the Reltroner Studio portfolio.  
Using Python, `pandas`, `NumPy`, and `Matplotlib`, the notebook [asthortera_starter_notebook.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12bC6Y0QGsw7xjloVMyObM6WQGBFcctgq?usp=sharing) analyzes demographic and economic indicators across five major nations — Reltronland, Depcutland, Aurastelia, Stelpadland, and Pencilfania.
