### 📊 IMI Overview
The **Interstellar Mobility Index (IMI)** is a composite score used to rank planetary hubs in terms of their **accessibility, connectivity, capacity, and velocity** for interstellar movement.

---

### 📐 Index Factors & Weights

#### 🔹 **Launch Throughput**  
**Weight:** 30%  
Daily number of successful interstellar departures

---

#### 🔹 **Transit Coverage**  
**Weight:** 25%  
Number of connected planets/systems via regular routes

---

#### 🔹 **Passenger Flux**  
**Weight:** 20%  
Volume of interstellar passengers per day

---

#### 🔹 **Energy Integration**  
**Weight:** 15%  
Efficiency of Aurora/Antimatter energy system coordination

---

#### 🔹 **Docking Efficiency**  
**Weight:** 10%  
Average turnaround time for interstellar vessels

### 🌐 IMI Scorecard (Top 5 Hubs)

#### 🥇 1. **PAIA — Pasgerflit Aeropolis International Airport Hub**  
**Planet:** Asthortera  
**IMI Score:** 99.1

---

#### 🥈 2. **RAIA — Reltronepolis Aeropolis**  
**Planet:** Asthortera  
**IMI Score:** 96.4

---

#### 🥉 3. **Ascendrium Starport**  
**Planet:** Cosmeilia  
**IMI Score:** 94.1

---

#### 4. **Depsair Omega Platform**  
**Planet:** Depeisit  
**IMI Score:** 88.7

---

#### 5. **Cistheta Ring Array**  
**Planet:** Cistheta  
**IMI Score:** 83.2

---

### 🔍 Insights
- **PAIA** leads the galaxy due to its massive infrastructure, energy harmonization, and citizen-centric boarding flow.
- **Cosmeilia** excels in soft-flight resonance but is limited to selective spiritual routes.
- **Depeisit** retains legacy power through industrial launch frequency but lacks SDI alignment.
