# Depeisit & Nytherion Abyss Connection

> *“They never worshiped the Abyss. They became it.”*

Depeisit, a civilization built on classical ideals and structured hierarchy, is not the birthplace of Nytherion Abyss—but it became the **perfect vessel** for its spread.

---

## 🌀 Ideological Convergence
Though not directly controlled by Nytherion, the societal values of Depeisit mirror its deepest illusions:

- **Comfort over change**
- **Routine over awakening**
- **Order over truth**

This alignment is not religious—it is **cultural**.
Nytherion does not demand faith. It thrives in stagnation.

> “The Abyss did not need to conquer Depeisit. It only needed them to stop growing.”
