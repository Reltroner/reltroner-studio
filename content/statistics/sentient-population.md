# üåå Sentient Composition Across Planets

This document provides a detailed overview of the sentient population structures across the three major inhabited planets within the Asthortera galaxy: **Asthortera**, **Depeisit**, and **Cosmeilia**.

## üåç **Planet Asthortera**
- **Dominant Population:** Humans with East Asian Mongoloid and Western European features
- **Total Sentient Population:** **~4.4 trillion**
- **Composition:**
  - 61% Human (Caucasian lineages)

- **Total Sentient Population:** **~25 trillion**
- **Composition:**
  - 92% Human (Caucasian origin)
  - 5% East Asian Mongoloid
  - 3% Technocratic descendants from lost colonies

## ü™ê **Planet Cistheta**
- **Dominant Population:** Humans of East Asian Mongoloid origin, known for high-speed innovation, structured collectivism, and cultural preservation
- **Total Sentient Population:** **~10 trillion**
- **Composition:**
  - 88% Human (East Asian Mongoloid Origin)
  - 6% Immigrants from Depeisit
  - 3% Immigrants from Asthortera
  - 2% Immigrants from Cosmeilia
  - 1% Others (mixed-origin sentients, hybrids)
- **Notable Characteristic:** Cistheta is a highly urbanized and digitalized planet that specializes in technocultural exports. Its population is known for integrating precision, ancestral reverence, and futuristic planning.

## üß† **Philosophical Summary**
> _‚ÄúSentience in Asthortera is not merely about species or race, but about alignment‚Äîspiritually, mentally, and structurally.‚Äù_

The racial composition of each planet reflects its function and aesthetic in the wider narrative:
- **Asthortera** is the balance of modern civilization and spiritual resistance.
- **Depeisit** preserves the old power, system, and decay.
- **Cosmeilia** advances beauty and universal consciousness.
- **Cistheta** embodies precision, order, and a futuristic collectivism rooted in ancestral honor.

Each planet has a different distribution, but all tie back into the larger cosmic balance of the Astralis and the threat of Nytherion.
