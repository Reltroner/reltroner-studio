# 📊 Sentient Development Index (SDI) Score Matrix

---

## 🧠 Overview
The **Sentient Development Index (SDI)** is the core metric used across Asthortera — and especially in **Reltronland** — to measure the overall developmental quality of an individual. Unlike traditional IQ or economic metrics, SDI integrates **intellectual, emotional, ethical, and productivity-based indicators** into a single compound score.

> _"In Reltronland, SDI is not just a number. It’s your trajectory."_

Each SDI score is composed of six weighted components:

1. **Cognitive Clarity (CC)** – 25%  
   _Measures logical thinking, pattern recognition, and truth-responsiveness._

2. **Emotional Stability (ES)** – 20%  
   _Gauges mental resilience, emotional regulation, and adaptability._

3. **Ethical Integrity (EI)** – 20%  
   _Evaluates alignment with Astralis values, rejection of entropy, and moral consistency._

4. **Time Discipline (TD)** – 15%  
   _Tracks time management, productivity ratio, and priority focus._

5. **Social Contribution (SC)** – 10%  
   _Measures value creation, teamwork, and civil participation._

6. **Innovation Quotient (IQx)** – 10%  
   _Assesses creative problem-solving and impact-driven thinking._
