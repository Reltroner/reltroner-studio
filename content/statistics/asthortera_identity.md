# Planet Asthortera

> *“A world not of escape—but evolution.”*

Asthortera is the central stage of the modern galaxy—a diverse, balanced, and aspirational planet known for its high Sentient Development Index (SDI), meritocratic values, and openness to interstellar migration.

## 🌍 Core Identity
- **Dominant Population:** Humans with East Asian Mongoloid and Western European features  
- **Total Sentient Population:** ~4.4 trillion  

### 🧬 Population Composition
Most of Asthortera's population growth stems from interstellar immigration. Citizens from collapsing or stagnant civilizations—such as Depeisit—arrive seeking opportunity, meritocracy, and personal reinvention. As a result, Asthortera has become not just a homeworld, but a symbol of second chances across the galaxy.

- 61% Human (Caucasian lineages)  
- 24% Human (East Asian Mongoloid)  
- 7% Human-Wizard-Witch (native Asthorteran race)  
- 5% Cosmeilia-Human Mixed  
- 3% Others (alien humanoids, hybrids)

It is viewed as:
- A **land of personal reinvention**

> “In Asthortera, rebirth is not a myth—it’s a migration.”

## 🌀 Spiritual & Political Balance
Unlike Depeisit (dominated by comfort politics), Asthortera is a **battlefield of competing ideologies**:
- **Red Pill Movements** (growth, awareness, anti-illusion)
- **Blue Pill Zones** (stagnant governments, hidden abyssal influence)
- **Neutral Wards** (autonomous zones, cultural preservation regions)

This diversity fuels both conflict and creativity.

## 💡 Final Thought
Asthortera is not perfect. But it is awake.
It does not offer peace—it offers progress.
A world that mirrors both the chaos of becoming, and the beauty of conscious civilization.
