# 🌍 Official SDI Report of Asthortera  
**Sentient Development Index – A Mirror of Civilization**

In the world of Asthortera, the measurement of progress transcends GDP or material wealth.  
Here, **SDI (Sentient Development Index)** is the ultimate indicator of a nation's collective growth.

**Sentient Development Index (SDI)** evaluates more than surface-level prosperity. It focuses on the inner infrastructure of a civilization:

- 🧠 **Cognitive & emotional maturity** of citizens
- 🌱 **Child resilience and curiosity levels**
- 🕊️ **Freedom from feudal or illusion-based systems**
- 📚 **Cultural prioritization** of education, healing, and self-awareness
- 🏡 **Decent standard of living** that promotes dignity and stability
- ❤️ **Holistic health**: both physical well-being and spiritual/emotional alignment

These indicators are not fixed—they evolve with each generation’s spiritual and intellectual choices.
