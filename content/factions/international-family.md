# 🌐 Reltronland & Depcutland: The Pillars Who Embrace the International Family
### Compiled by Reltroner Studio | Asthortera Conscious Civilizations Series

## 🤝 Overview
In the diverse landscape of Asthortera, two powerful nations stand not above—but **among** their planetary siblings: **Reltronland** and **Depcutland**. Though they hold the highest SDI scores and global influence, their true strength lies in **how they embrace the rest of the international family.**

> *“To rise in consciousness is to extend the hand, not to raise the crown.”*
