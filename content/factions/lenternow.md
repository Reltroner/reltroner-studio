## 💡 Illuminary Bonds — Lanternow's Light-Based Public Investment Model

> *"Invest not in profit, but in glow."*

---

### What Are Illuminary Bonds?

**Illuminary Bonds** are a unique class of public investment assets in Lenternow, designed to allow citizens and international partners to invest in the expansion, maintenance, and innovation of the nation's lantern infrastructure.

Rather than being tied to traditional interest rates, Illuminary Bonds offer returns based on:

* **Urban Illumination Metrics**
* **Nightwalk Tourism Activity**
* **Cultural Lighting Engagement Index (CLEI)**
* **Glow Efficiency Ratings** from key districts

---

### 🧾 How It Works

1. **Issued by:** The *Council of Illuminaries* under the Ministry of Luminara Finance
2. **Purpose:** Fund new lantern districts, intelligent lighting systems, and cultural glow installations
3. **Term Lengths:** 1, 3, and 7 lunar years
4. **Returns:** Paid in \$LNR or digital *Glow Credits*, calculated based on public light metrics instead of inflation or GDP

---

### 📊 Glow Performance Formula

```
Bond Yield (%) = 2.5 + (CLEI × 0.3) + (District Glow Score × 0.15)
```

Where:

* CLEI: Cultural Lighting Engagement Index (scale of 0–100)
* District Glow Score: Average of top 5 lantern-lit districts

---

### 🌐 Why It Matters

* **Democratizes beauty** — Citizens can invest directly in aesthetics
* **Incentivizes harmony** — Encourages well-maintained, community-driven illumination
* **Cultural capital** becomes **financial capital**
* **Engages diaspora & off-world investors** who admire Lenternow's nightscapes

---

### 🏛️ Notable Projects Funded by Illuminary Bonds

* **The 9th Layer Glow Grid** in Inferminte
* **Sentient Lantern Avenue** in Glisterria
* **Skybridge of Soft Light** connecting old and new districts in Lighteralis

---

### 🛑 Risks & Retention Policies

* Bonds are non-transferrable in black markets
* Subject to deduction if districts fall below 70% Glow Compliance
* Early withdrawal incurs a Dim-Loss Penalty (DLP)

---

### 🔮 Final Note

Illuminary Bonds are not just a financial tool — they are an invitation to shape the atmosphere, light by light, vision by vision.

> *“The most valuable return is not currency, but continuity of glow.”*
