# 🌌 Aurastelia Olympic Doctrine
**By Queen Valethra Seraphine Lunara**  

## 1. Athlete Recruitment and Selection
- **Spiritual Alignment First**  
  All candidates must undergo the **Polaris Ritual** to align their personal intention with the _"Aurora of Clarity"_. This ensures their motives are rooted in internal balance, not ego or external pressure.

- **Multidimensional Screening**  
  Selection is based on **Spiritual Quotient (SQ)**, **Intelligence Quotient (IQ)**, and **Emotional Quotient (EQ)**, not just physical or academic scores.

---

## 2. Training Philosophy and Education
- **No Coach, Only Mentors**  
  Athletes are guided by **spiritual and scientific mentors**, rather than traditional coaches.

- **Training of Resonance**  
  Focus is placed on inner frequency training—resonance of the body, thoughtwaves, and movement harmony.

- **Nature-Integrated Training**  
  Training facilities are built inside **natural aurora gardens**, **reflective lakes**, and **orbital towers**, enhancing connection with cosmic flows.

---

## 3. Moral and Logistical Support
- **Zero Exploitation Decree**  
  No political or corporate pressure is permitted. Athletes are **value explorers**, not national commodities.

- **Celestlight Subsidy**  
  All provisions are covered under the **Celestlight Harmony Fund**, ensuring no branding interference.

- **Aurastelian Diplomatic Immunity**  
  Athletes are officially recognized as **Polaris Envoys**, under full diplomatic protection throughout the Games.

---

## 4. Health and Emotional Stability Protocol
- **Therapeutic Aurora Chamber**  
  Athletes have access to meditation rooms with **aurora resonance stabilizers** to maintain mental balance.

- **Memory Whispering Access**  
  For knowledge-based disciplines, athletes may temporarily access the **Collective Memory Archive**, supervised by the Polaris Council.

---

## 5. Departure Ceremony
- **Skyborne Ceremony**  
  Queen Valethra conducts a celestial farewell, embedding the **Crystal of Grace** into each delegate’s heart.

> _“You are not sent to conquer,  
> but to mirror the soul of our people.  
> Let them see light without glare.”_

---

## 6. Conduct During the Olympics
- **No Nation Above Others**  
  Aurastelian delegates are not to express superiority. The goal is **truthful representation**, not domination.

- **Support All Sentient Beings**  
  Any struggling competitor from other nations must be aided in the name of **Unity of Aurora**.

---

## 7. Post-Olympics
- **Collective Reflection, Not Celebration**  
  Upon return, delegates enter a **3-day Ritual of Reflection** at the Polaris Temple—media blackout enforced.

- **Transmutation Ceremony**  
  All medals and records are transformed into **light essence** and archived in the **Aurora Memory Vault** as legacy values, not ego relics.

---

> This doctrine reflects the luminous path of Aurastelia — where victory lies in grace, not in glory.
