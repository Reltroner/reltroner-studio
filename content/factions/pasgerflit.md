## 🛡️ National Values

### 🛫 Mobility Clarity  
**“One must not move without meaning.”**  
Before transit begins, the **intent** must be purified.  
All journeys must be preceded by internal alignment — *Why am I moving?*

---

### 🎧 Stillness in Motion  
**“Engines may roar — but your sentience must remain still.”**  
Even amidst noise, turbulence, or urgency, a traveler must maintain **inner tranquility**.  
Stillness is not external silence — it's the mastery of your state during transition.

---

### ✈️ Transit Merit  
**“The journey is the offering.”**  
Arriving at a destination has no virtue if the process was fragmented, aggressive, or mindless.  
**How** you travel becomes part of your sentient ledger.

---

### 🛬 Landing Ethics  
**“Do not land where your presence disturbs the soulfield.”**  
Every place has a spiritual boundary.  
Landing in a territory — physical or social — where your presence is unwanted breaks resonance law.  
You must be **invited by clarity**, not just permitted by clearance.

---

### 🌫️ Sky Sovereignty  
**“The sky is not for domination.”**  
Airspace is sacred.  
It must never be used for **coercion, destruction, or intimidation**.  
Even RSC aircraft are bound by this — **presence is projection**, not assertion.

---

> “Transit is not escape.  
> It is continuity — of purpose, of clarity, and of self.”  
> — *Aviatic Doctrine of the Astralis Pinnacle*
