---

**Scene: Morning boardroom inside a gleaming skyscraper in Reltronepolis. Reltronball is seated with a castella cake and cup of tea. Depcutball arrives, adjusting his bowtie.**

**🟦 Reltronball:** "Welcome to the Sentient Progress Summit. Please sanitize your monocle."

**🟫 Depcutball:** "Sanitize? My monocle survived a hundred philosophical debates in Depsetica."

**🟦 Reltronball:** "And yet it still fogs when the truth arrives."

*Depcutball raises one brow. Reltronball offers castella.*

**🟦 Reltronball:** "No coffee served here. Castella and clarity only."

**🟫 Depcutball:** "Outrageous. In Depcutland, even babies are introduced to espresso with Latin etymology."

*They pause. Silence. Mutual squinting.*

**🟦 Reltronball:** "Shall we begin the Comparative Index of Institutional Resilience?"

**🟫 Depcutball:** "With pleasure. After I realign this chair to a 92° philosophical angle."

---

*They sit. They debate. They argue like two old professors who secretly admire each other.*

**[Caption]**: *They disagree on everything... except one thing: bureaucracy is a sacred art.*

**Scene: Depcutland’s Ministry of Beverage Ethics. Depcutball is pacing nervously with a stack of parchment. Reltronball arrives, calmly sipping tea from a biodegradable cup.**

**🟫 Depcutball:** "It’s catastrophic! The espresso rail from Depsetica is delayed by 8.4 hours!"

**🟦 Reltronball:** "Tea shipments from Reltralia continue unimpeded. Would you like a jasmine-infused solution?"

**🟫 Depcutball:** "Don’t you dare diplomatically tea-splain me in the middle of a caffeine crisis!"

**🟦 Reltronball:** "Very well. Let’s convene a cross-nation task force: Bureau of Beverage Continuity."

**🟫 Depcutball:** "Make it bipartisan. And no matcha delegation."

*They walk toward the Emergency Aroma Simulation Room. The alarm reads: “CAFFEINE RESERVES: 17%.”*

**🟦 Reltronball:** "Perhaps… it’s time you tried castella with tranquility instead."

**🟫 Depcutball:** *(grumbles)* "This is a national emergency, not a bakery field trip."

---

**[Caption]**: *In the absence of coffee, only diplomacy and pastry shall prevail.*

---

**Scene: The Grand Archive Vault in Reltralia. A giant automated door opens with the sound of soft harps. Depcutball enters, slightly disheveled, tie-less. Reltronball is already inside, hovering over ancient scrolls.**

**🟦 Reltronball:** *(stares silently)* "...You're not wearing a tie."

**🟫 Depcutball:** "It’s laundry day. My cravat union protested."

**🟦 Reltronball:** "Entry without neck formalwear is a Class B deviation under Article III of the Public Clarity Act."

**🟫 Depcutball:** *(muttering)* "Do not weaponize fashion against me... again."

**🟦 Reltronball:** "Very well. Temporary exception granted. But you’ll be issued a philosophical citation."

*Depcutball pulls out a notebook and scribbles: “Emotional damage: mild. Dignity: compromised.”*

*They continue browsing ancient scrolls titled: “The First Castella Consensus” and “Zoning the Enlightened Spirit.”*

**🟫 Depcutball:** "Your archive smells like chamomile."

**🟦 Reltronball:** "All truth does."

---

**[Caption]**: *Even without a tie, bureaucracy never forgets.*

### "Reltronball Attends a Depcutland Opera (And Almost Falls Asleep)"

 ![comicball-episode4](/images/comicball-episode4.webp)

---

**Scene: The Grand Velvetrum Opera Hall, Depsetica. A majestic orchestra is tuning. Reltronball sits upright in a box seat, adjusting his clarity pin. Depcutball is beside him, in full ceremonial bowtie attire.**

**🟫 Depcutball:** "Tonight’s performance: ‘Symphony for Three Monocles and a Lament.’ 148 minutes, no intermission."

**🟦 Reltronball:** *(nervously)* "Does the lament resolve in productivity or perish in existential drift?"

**🟫 Depcutball:** "Depends on the conductor’s mood and humidity."

**Scene: The orchestra begins. Violins cry. Harps whisper. The second act features a solo triangle played with a quill pen.**

*Reltronball begins blinking slowly.*

**🟫 Depcutball:** *(whispering)* "This movement is titled: ‘Bureaucratic Yearning in D Minor.’"

*Reltronball snoozes with perfect posture, head slightly tilted.*

**🟫 Depcutball:** *(smirks)* "Only Reltronball could fall asleep during an arpeggio of institutional longing."

---

**[Caption]**: *Even in dreams, the paperwork continues.*

### "Depcutball Tries a Castella Cake (And Files a 17-Page Review)"

 ![comicball-episode5](/images/comicball-episode5.webp)

**Scene: Reltronball’s minimalist rooftop tea garden overlooking Reltralia’s skyline. A small plate with a perfectly sliced castella cake sits between them. Depcutball eyes it like it’s a philosophical trap.**

**🟦 Reltronball:** "It’s not a trap. It’s a tradition."

**🟫 Depcutball:** *(inspecting texture)* "It has suspicious softness. No existential crust."

**🟦 Reltronball:** "That’s the point. It’s softness within structure."

*Depcutball takes one bite. Eyes widen subtly.*

**🟫 Depcutball:** "Notes of vanilla. A hint of self-discipline. Mouthfeel reminiscent of... dignified regret."

**🟦 Reltronball:** "Would you like a second piece?"

**🟫 Depcutball:** "Only after I complete a full sensory audit."

*Depcutball opens a leather-bound journal titled: “Epistemology of Edibles.” He begins writing furiously.*

**🟫 Depcutball:** *(reading aloud)* "Page 1: Castella as culinary metaphor for ethical elegance…"
