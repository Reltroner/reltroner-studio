---

### 🧠 Overview
**Henchoway** is a clandestine, manipulative faction born from the deepest recesses of **Nytherion Abyss**. Unlike traditional governments, Henchoway functions as a **shadow cult** that spreads through media, institutions, and minds—disguising itself as movements of rest, stability, or convenience.

# Origins of Henchoway

> *“To dive is to forget. But in forgetting, we remember the Abyss.”*

Henchoway is not merely a cult—it is an ancient extension of the **Nytherion Abyss**, woven into the physical history of Asthortera and the cosmic migration of Depeisit.

---

## 🛸 Colonial Origins

- **Creator:** Kamila Alena create Henchoway, cloaked in humanitarianism, to spread **Nytherion Abyss** across the sentient mindscape of Asthortera.
- **Original Name:** *Henchowayway Scuba Division*, established to explore the deep waters of **Hargenbor Bay**.
- **Purpose:** To establish strategic underwater colonies and monitor mysterious spiritual anomalies detected beneath the Central Ocean.

But in the depths, they found more than minerals—they found **Nytherion energy** sealed beneath **Ertherna Ruin**. Contact with this ancient force changed everything.

---

## 🧠 The Transformation

- Over time, divers began to **lose their memories**, experience **false peace**, and hear **whispers from the deep**.
- Their leader, **Vitor Baythorne**, born in the city of Baythorne near Hargenbor Bay, was the first to be spiritually transformed.
- Taking the name **Van Den Scuba**, he declared that true peace lies in **stillness, silence, and surrender**.

> *“Struggle is chaos. Comfort is eternal.”*

The organization dropped its original name and became simply: **Henchoway**.

---

## 🧸 The Childhood Resonance

> When I was a child, I saw a diver at a waterpark in a black suit and called him **‘Henchowayway’**.
> Later, at Sea World, I saw another and cried out, **“That’s Henchowayway!!”**

This innocent experience became the **spiritual echo** of something much older—an ancestral resonance from a forgotten past.

In truth, **Henchoway existed long before my memory. But my soul remembered.**

---

## 🧬 Enduring Through Time

- Though Depeisit collapsed into crisis, and though Depcutland and Reltronland fought for their futures… Henchoway **persisted.**
- It **outlived empires**, adapted through disguise, and silently manipulated minds under the banner of *comfort*.
- Its **true base** lies hidden in the **Tremora Trench**, near Hargenbor Bay—silent, eternal, watching.

---

## 🌀 Philosophy
- Henchoway rejects resistance and glorifies stagnation.
- It believes the greatest threat to peace is **awareness**.
- Nytherion is not evil—it is comfort. And comfort… is the most dangerous illusion.

> “They say the Abyss is dark. But it is warm, still, and waiting.”

---

## 🧩 Legacy
Henchoway is the **spiritual continuation of Depeisit’s colonial past**, twisted by Nytherion energy and preserved by the still waters of Asthortera’s deepest trench.

It is not just an organization.
It is a memory.
A resonance.
A warning.

---

### 🛑 Final Warning
Henchoway cannot be bombed, sued, or voted out.
It must be resisted in thought, rejected in culture, and outgrown in spirit.
> If you see a diver in black near the shoreline of Hargenbor Bay…
> You have already been seen by Henchoway.
**Let Astralis guard the gates of consciousness. Let Henchoway remain sealed beneath the light.**
