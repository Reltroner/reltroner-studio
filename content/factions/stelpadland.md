# 🍁 Stelpadland — Cradle of Global Scouting and Eternal Autumn

**Stelpadland** is a sovereign nation in the world of Asthortera, widely regarded as the birthplace of global scouting culture. Founded in **2882 BAC** by **Scot Stetson**, a legendary explorer and sentient guide from **Stelhaven, Kalgered**, Stelpadland is known for its eternal autumn atmosphere, wooden cities, and deep-rooted harmony with nature.

---

## 🧭 Founding Origins

In **2882 BAC**, a visionary named **Scot Stetson**—a native Asthorteran human born before the arrival of Depeisit and Cistheta settlers—departed from his hometown **Stelhaven** to explore the uncharted eastern forests. His goal was not conquest, but cultivation of inner strength through survival, peace, and wisdom in the wilderness.

### 🏕️ The Founding Vision

* Scot Stetson pioneered the first international scouting codes.
* He built wooden sanctuaries, survival camps, and crafted guides on empathy, leadership, and earth-based living.
* His teachings were later adopted across **all nations in Asthortera**—from Reltronland to Aurastelia—as a model for youth development.

> "To lead is to serve the forest, not to tame it." — Scot Stetson

## 📜 Historical Background of Stelpadland

Before becoming a nation, the region now known as Stelpadland was an untamed woodland zone filled with maple valleys, high-altitude lakes, and sacred trees worshipped by native Asthorterans and Dendrilis tribes. During the ancient spiritual period, this region was considered off-limits to expansionist factions.

### 🌿 Pre-Founding Era (Pre-2900 BAC)

* Populated by small nomadic communities and woodland mystics who believed the forest itself held memory.
* Known as the *“Sleeping Flamewood”* due to the way the autumn canopy shimmered like fire yet remained untouched.

### 🚶‍♂️ Arrival of Scot Stetson (2882 BAC)

* Left Kalgered to pursue a calling he described as *"the whisper of still leaves."*
* Established a scouting haven with natural ethics, survivalist philosophy, and a pact with nature-bound beings.
* Declared the land a sovereign educational sanctuary—not a kingdom.

### 🛡️ Recognition of Stelpadland

* By 2800 BAC, major spiritual and technological states recognized Stelpadland as a **neutral scout nation**.
* Kalgered signed the *Maple Concord*, affirming Stelpadland’s educational sovereignty.
* By 974 BAC, Reltronland began sending candidates to train under the “Stetson Codes.”

> “Where armies trained to conquer, we trained to coexist.” — Maple Concord Archive

### 📈 Growth into National Identity

* Between 2750–2100 BAC, wooden cities emerged—camouflaged into nature, never disrupting canopy flows.
* Culture of ritual, scouting, wooden arts, and mysticism solidified.
* No recorded wars. Defensive magic and geographic isolation kept Stelpadland free from invasion.
