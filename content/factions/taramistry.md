## 🌬️ Guiding Ideology: **Synthetism of Merit**

### Core Principles

* **Synthesis over Imitation:** Every invention must bridge multiple disciplines to create something novel.
* **Evidence before Authority:** Scientific data outranks titles and status.
* **Healthcare as Citizenship:** Access is universal; participation in innovation is a civic responsibility.
* **Ethics in Acceleration:** Speed must be balanced with deep bioethical scrutiny.

### Manifestations

* **Replication Week:** National re-testing of major findings.
* **MedCreds System:** Tax credits for clinical volunteers.
* **Three-Gate Protocol:** Ideas must pass Ethics, Efficacy, and Sustainability gates before national deployment.
