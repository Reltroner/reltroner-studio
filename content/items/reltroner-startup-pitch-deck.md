# Name Ideas

> This playbook is up to date with your idea board. However, you can always regenerate it if you don't like the results.

## High-Level Naming Strategy

For your modular ERP system with unified login, the name must convey clarity, innovation, and potential to solve complex problems for scaling startups. The target customers include tech-savvy startups, digital agencies, and small to medium businesses seeking sophisticated yet affordable ERP solutions. The name should evoke a sense of high-tech professionalism, autonomy, and secure streamlining.

## Name Options and Rationale

### 1. Synaptic

**Why It Works:** Synaptic invokes the idea of seamless connections, akin to synapses in the brain. It reflects the unified integration your ERP system offers across various operations—like how synapses connect neurons. This name conveys intelligence and efficiency, linking well with the idea of enhancing a business's operational capacity.

### 2. FluxGrid

**Why It Works:** Combining “flux” with “grid,” this name suggests a dynamic system with powerful interconnections. It communicates the adaptable and scalable nature of your ERP modules. The term "grid" implies organization and structure, while "flux" hints at progress and change, aligning with your system's capability to evolve with business needs.

### 3. CohortCloud

**Why It Works:** CohortCloud reflects community and connectivity, ideal for collaboration-focused companies. It captures the spirit of collective growth—your target users are those needing to unify disparate or fragmented systems into one cohesive cloud-based structure.

**Visual Identity:** The cloud metaphoric aspect might inspire design elements like interconnected shapes or ambient gradients.

### 4. NexusNode

**Why It Works:** NexusNode emphasizes a central hub or node where everything converges, echoing your product's ability to centralize operations and actions. "Nexus" signals connectivity, while "Node" indicates key technological components, appealing to technical customers seeking robust system architecture.

**Brand Narrative:** Highlight the hub concept in marketing material; position NexusNode as the pivotal point of organizational synergy.

### 5. OrbisOS

**Why It Works:** Derived from Latin "orbis" meaning circle, OrbisOS suggests comprehensive coverage and continuous system support—ideal for the modular nature of your platform. The addition of "OS" connects to operating systems, indicating a comprehensive, underlying infrastructure for businesses.

**Cross-Cultural Insights:** Emphasize the Latin roots in messaging to resonate with a global audience, ensuring clarity and cultural adaptability.

## Psychological and Linguistic Principles

**Phonetic Appeal:** Each name leverages distinct sounds, such as the hard "C" or "N" in CohortCloud or NexusNode, adding memorability. The names cater to cognitive fluency—easy pronunciation encourages quick mental processing and recall, crucial in a tech-savvy market.

**Emotional Resonance:** Names like Synaptic and OrbisOS trigger associations of intelligence and completeness, essential emotional triggers for decision-makers prioritizing operational excellence.

## Channel Strategy and Applicability

**Channel Compatibility:** These names are optimized for channels like Indie Hackers and Dev.to. They fit naturally into tech conversations and content marketing, easily integrated into articles, tutorials, and case studies, making them ideal for both verbal pitch and written content.

**Future Scalability:** Names like FluxGrid and NexusNode are versatile enough to accommodate future product extensions. They can support additional modules or services beyond ERP, ensuring the brand name remains consistent as you evolve.

Selecting an apt, impactful name for your ERP system can significantly shape its market perception and success. Each of these options not only addresses the core user challenges but also encapsulates the uniqueness of your offering, enhancing your brand’s positioning in the competitive tech landscape.

# 🧠 How I Built a $249K-Scored Startup Idea in Indie Hackers
**by Rei Reltroner — Founder of Reltroner Studio**  
_Last updated: June 11, 2025_

---

## 🔷 Overview
In this post, I’ll break down exactly how I crafted and submitted a startup idea that scored **$249,049** on Indie Hackers’ Idea Board and ranked **#181 globally**. This wasn’t just a random success — it was a result of months of structured thinking, positioning, and tech strategy.

---

## 🚀 Idea at a Glance
- **Title:** Enterprise-Grade Modular ERP System with Unified Authentication  
- **Score:** $249,049  
- **Global Rank:** #181  
- **Core Stack:** Laravel 12, Keycloak SSO, Tailwind, MySQL, Modular Architecture  
- **Main Value:** Enterprise-level tools for startups, accessible without enterprise-level complexity.

---

## 🧩 My Building Blocks

### ✅ 1. Customer Pain Points
I identified a rising problem among startup founders and digital agencies:
- Disorganized user access across tools  
- No time or skills to manage infrastructure  
- Compliance and audit pain with login security  
- Lack of DevOps/backend capacity

I reframed these not as technical issues, but as **business obstacles**.

---

### ✅ 2. Clear Revenue Model
I offered a **modular licensing system** for ERP + authentication solutions:
- Free trial (freemium) for 14 days  
- Paid license (start from $15M–75M IDR/project)  
- Optional SSO integration, analytics, and white-label pricing

---

### ✅ 3. Product Differentiation
Unlike bloated ERP suites, my product:
- Uses SSO (Keycloak) out of the box  
- Is built by a solo founder from scratch  
- Supports solo or small teams with 2–3 weeks setup  
- Doesn't require DevOps or full-stack engineering hires

---

### ✅ 4. Organic & Paid Channels
I laid out a multi-channel marketing plan:
- **Organic:** Indie Hackers, Twitter, Dev.to deep dives  
- **Paid:** Cold outreach to funded startups (via Crunchbase, AngelList)  
- **Partnerships:** White-label tech for creative/web agencies  

---

### ✅ 5. Viral Loop Strategy
Free users can invite team members, generate reports with "Powered by Reltroner" branding, and showcase ERP success to attract partners.

---

## 💥 Key Learnings

#### ✅ What Worked

* Clear tech-for-business storytelling
* Freemium + licensing model synergy
* Deep integration of modular structure

---

#### 🛠️ What I’ll Improve

* Sharper core value articulation

You just need:
- A real problem  
- Real empathy for users  
- A system you believe in  
- And the guts to ship, validate, and repeat.

**Let Astralis light the unknown.** 🌌
