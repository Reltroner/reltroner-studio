## 🔥 Tension Scene: The Blood Trench Confrontation

The storm split the sky in violet flashes. Beneath the electro-ash, the black soil trembled. RSC soldiers, hidden within crumbled polycrete, held their breath. The noise of **Abyss Convoy-7** approached—six twisted transport trucks flanked by two **Abyss Tanks**, emitting violet smog.

**Captain Vyrell Castor**, leader of the Vanguard cell, whispered through comms:

> *“Target lock on command. Wait until you feel the metal quake. That’s when you fire.”*

Seconds later, **twin Abyss mortars** launched smoke canisters. The sky went black. And that’s when the Earth screamed.

RSC’s forward turret **MECH-R92** fired first, disabling the left tank in a split-second plasma burst. Screams. Echoes. The enemy opened wild fire, illuminating the ash clouds with abyssal tracer rounds.

> *“Push now! Zone-4 breach—NOW!”* shouted Lieutenant Erra, leaping from the trench.

Dozens followed. Plasma bayonets met abyssal rifles. Blood met rust. And in the center of the chaos, a corrupted **Abyss Priest Unit** began channeling a psychic tremor. The air convulsed.

**Private Lirsen** tackled the priest with a kinetic grenade. *Boom—voidlight implosion.* The tremor collapsed.

> *“No collapse today!”* shouted Vyrell. *“We hold. For Astralis. For Vanyathra!”*

## 🕯️ Field Log Entry

> *“Blood soaked the dust, but we did not fall. The void blinked—but we stared back harder. Vanyathra remains broken, but we are the ones who still write its chapters.”*
