# 🗓️ Timeline: History of Asthortera, Reltronland, and Depcutland

This timeline captures the major arcs that define Asthortera’s geopolitical, cultural, and spiritual history—tracking early civilizations, cosmic migrations, colonial crises, independence wars, and the formation of modern superpowers.

From the ancient harmony of **Beluftner**, the galactic wisdom of **Cosmeilia**, to the foundational divides between **Reltronland** and **Depcutland**, this record serves as the backbone of worldbuilding across all narrative series in the **Reltroner Studio Universe**.

> ⚠️ *Note: This timeline is an evolving canon and may be refined in future iterations based on new lore revelations and narrative consistency checks.*

---

## ✨ Unified Timeline: History of Asthortera, Reltronland, and Depcutland

**Era System:** BAC (Before Asthortera Common) / AC (Asthortera Common)

---

## 🌌 Ancient and Proto-Civilization Era

**7478 BAC** — *Origin of Beluftner*
- Beluftner civilization rises as Asthortera's first sentient society.
- They build the city of **Beluer Origin** and uphold harmony between magic and nature.

**4757 BAC** — *Beluftner Expansion*
- Beluftner culture spreads into what will become Reltronland and Depcutland.
- Reltronland: a fertile valley. Depcutland: lowland forests to the northwest.

---

## 🚀 3535 BAC — *Arrival of Cosmeilia*

> *“They did not arrive to conquer stars, but to harmonize with their silence.”*

Cosmic races from the distant planet **Cosmeilia** reach Asthortera.  
They land first in the **Astrostelia** region, later spreading to what would become **Aurastelia**.

- The migration is peaceful, almost ritualistic.
- They are not colonizers, but sentient seekers of alignment and resonance.

---

## ⚔️ 3364–3352 BAC — *Beluftner–Cosmeilia Conflict*

> *“Before peace settled into the land, the stars trembled under divided visions of balance.”*

This period marks a spiritual and territorial standoff between the **ancient Beluftner civilization** and newly arrived **Cosmeilian settlers**.

- The Beluftner upheld a nature-bound harmony rooted in elemental control.
- The Cosmeilians, by contrast, followed cosmic resonance and inner light.

Though no full-scale war erupted, this **ideological collision** led to friction over sacred leylines, spiritual domains, and cosmic observatories.

> 🌠 *“It was not a war of weapons, but a war of frequencies.”*

---

## 🕊️ 3500–3200 BAC — *Proto-Realm Era: Stillness After the Rift*

> *“From the echo of dissonance emerged a silence so deep, it became the foundation of two futures.”*

The aftermath of the Beluftner–Cosmeilia conflict gave rise to the **Proto-Realm Era** — an age defined by spiritual healing, introspection, and cosmic recalibration.

During this time, Cosmeilian-Human hybrids established sanctuaries rather than kingdoms, choosing resonance over conquest.

### Key Highlights:
- Creation of *light sanctums*, aurora gardens, and meditation zones.
- Settlement across **northern Asthortera**, where leyline and aurora flows were strongest.
- Birth of the philosophical divergence between **Aurastelia** and **Astrostelia**.

---

## 🔀 Emerging Divergence: Spiritual vs Scientific Inclination

By the end of the Proto-Realm Era, the Cosmeilian settlers began to part into two distinct yet harmonious pathways:

* **The Path of Inward Resonance** emerged in the region that would later become **Aurastelia**.
  In the region that would become **Aurastelia**, groups turned to emotional clarity and aurora alignment.  
  They built their culture around stillness, silence, and soul refinement. Those who followed this path chose a life of contemplative silence, focusing on **preserving inner peace and maintaining aurora frequency**. They believed that true strength came from emotional clarity and spiritual alignment with the natural flows of the world.

* **The Path of Outward Vision** took shape in the lands that would become **Astrostelia**.
  In what would become **Astrostelia**, others looked to the stars—constructing observatories and charting cosmic structures.  
  Their identity flourished through science, cosmology, and interstellar philosophy. This group turned their attention skyward, driven by a desire to **explore cosmic structures, gather interstellar data, and advance scientific understanding**. For them, knowledge and exploration were the purest expressions of harmony.

> Although their destinations differed, their origin was one — and their divergence was a flowering, not a fracture.

> *“One looked inward to illuminate the soul. One looked outward to map the stars. Both remembered the light.”*

This divergence is the **seed of two luminous nations**, not in opposition—but in resonance through distinction.

> 🌠 *“What began as one light, chose two paths—not because it fractured, but because it grew.”*

## 🍁 Stelpadland Founding Origins

In **2882 BAC**, a visionary named **Scot Stetson**—a native Asthorteran human born before the arrival of Depeisit and Cistheta settlers—departed from his hometown **Stelhaven** to explore the uncharted eastern forests. His goal was not conquest, but cultivation of inner strength through survival, peace, and wisdom in the wilderness.

### 📈 Growth into National Identity

* Between 2750–2432 BAC, wooden cities emerged—camouflaged into nature, never disrupting canopy flows.
