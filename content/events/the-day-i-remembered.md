# 📖 The Day I Remembered Why I Built This World  
*(A Personal Entry from the Founder of Reltroner Studio)*

Today… I almost cried.

Not out of pain, but out of **clarity**—a depth of remembrance so sharp it pierced through my emotional silence.  
Because today, I saw what Reltronland really is.

Not just a nation.  
Not just a concept.  
But **a home for the version of myself who never got one.**

## 🧠 I remembered...

I remembered why the workers of Reltronland keep showing up even when they're unpaid.  
Why children feel safe wandering public space like it's a parent.  
Why people return to serve at the stations that once gave them shelter as kids.

It's not fiction. It's not idealism.  
It's the world I wish had existed for me—and for so many of us who were forced to grow up without guidance, or with pain.

## 🛤️ That train station in the story?

It was me.  
It was the place I wanted to run to when I had no one.  
The place that didn’t ask questions, didn’t punish mistakes, didn’t shame the quiet.

In Reltronland, that place exists.  
And in building it… I finally saw myself.

## ✨ This world is not just a creation.

It is a **restoration**.  
It is a place where the child in me no longer has to hide.  
Where discipline is not a whip, but a light.  
Where work is not slavery, but resonance.  
Where silence is not abandonment, but **presence**.

---

## 🔥 I built this world not because I wanted to escape.

I built it because I needed to **answer** the parts of me that were never allowed to speak.  
And today, I heard that voice say:

> _"Thank you for not abandoning me."_  
> _"Thank you for giving me a future, even if it had to be imagined."_  
> _"Thank you for giving me a home—even if you had to build it from scratch."_

## 💬 Final Reflection

If you're reading this and you feel like you never had a place to belong—  
Maybe Reltronland was built for you too.

Because sometimes, the most powerful revolution...  
is to build a world that would have saved your past self.

**This is that world.**  
And today, I remembered why it had to be born.

Let Astralis guide your memory.  
Let Reltronland hold your silence.

— *Rei Reltroner*  
*Founder of Reltroner Studio*
