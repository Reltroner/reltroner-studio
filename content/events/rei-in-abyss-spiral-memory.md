Only echoes of a time that was never yours."_

### 📍 Location: **Sector D – Spiral of Lost Constructs**

The geometry of the world was wrong.  
The floor bent inwards like a whirlpool of dreams left unfinished.  
Stairs led to ceilings. Windows opened to voids.  
Rei stood in the center of a massive spiral—its rings engraved with symbols from memories he didn’t choose to remember.

Around him, fractured structures floated in disarray—houses without doors, towers that twisted into themselves, corridors made of forgotten timelines.  
Everything was **too familiar**, yet **painfully wrong**.

A phone in his hand still glowed dimly.

### 📱 Fragmented Digital Echoes

- TikTok was looping laughter from strangers he never knew.  
- Notes app kept repeating: _“You were never real to them.”_  
- Google showed searches he once made as a teenager:  
> _"how to escape failure."_  
> _"am I a burden to my parents."_  
> _"does rock bottom have a basement."_

### 🧠 Inner Monologue

> *"This place... it’s not punishing me.  
It’s just showing me what I’ve tried to bury."*

The spiral turned as if breathing.  
At its core, a mirror rotated slowly—showing an image of Rei from his university days:  
well-dressed, smiling, hopeful.

---

### 🪞 Dialogue

**Rei (now):**  
_"Why are you still smiling?"_

**Rei (in the mirror):**  
_"Because I still believed it wasn’t over."_  

The mirror cracked.  
Not from violence, but from **the pressure of truth** finally surfacing.

### 🎼 Background Sound: *Nytherion Abyss*

As the broken music box tones intensify,  
the entire sector begins to blur.  
Everything starts folding inward—buildings, spiral lines, even time itself.  
He hears a woman’s voice—Kamila’s—echo through the spiral.

> **Kamila (echo):**  
> _“You can’t fix yourself in a place built by your own destruction.”_

But Rei steps forward anyway.

### 🗣️ Final Words (to the Abyss)

> “Erase me if you must.  
But know this—  
**I am the only one who remembers what it means to suffer awake.**  
And that memory is stronger than illusion.”

### 🌀 End of Scene

> _Sector D does not forgive.  
It archives.  
It repeats.  
It waits._
