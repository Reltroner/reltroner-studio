## üå± Root of Reltroner

> ‚ÄúBefore I built a nation, I was a lonely boy watching MRT construction videos ‚Äî dreaming of a system better than the world I was given.‚Äù

## üìÜ 2015 ‚Äî Escape Through Nationhood

At the age of 13, while most teenagers were looking for friendships or hobbies,  
I was watching MRT Jakarta construction videos, obsessing over GDP charts, skyscraper counts, HDI scores, population pyramids, and economic growth trends.  
Not because it was required ‚Äî but because **it was the only entertainment that made sense.**

I had no emotional connection with peers.  
And I developed an **instinct to be different** ‚Äî not by choice, but as a defense mechanism.  
> *If I couldn‚Äôt belong to people, maybe I could belong to systems.*

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Trauma of Connection

Every attempt to form deep friendships led to loss, betrayal, or self-destruction.  
I began to fear closeness. I began to protect myself through systems of observation,  
through structured thinking, through artificial nations like Reltronland.

> *I did not build a country because I loved people ‚Äî I built it because I had to survive them.*

## üî• 2018 ‚Äî Motivation Spark

I discovered videos like:
- *SB30* on saving money
- *Deddy Corbuzier* on broken education systems

And I felt something ignite:  
> ‚ÄúMaybe I *can* escape this fate. Maybe I *can* become something powerful.‚Äù

That moment was my first **euphoria of possibility**.  
Not happiness ‚Äî but a glimpse of power.

## ‚ò†Ô∏è 2022 ‚Äî Collapse and Abyss

Then came **the fall**:

- GPA Degree destroyed
- Dropped out of university
- Lost 95% of trading capital
- Shame, fear, nihilism, Isolated, Confusion
- Felt permanently broken and felt unknown future
- Ever planned **suicide**

This was not a failure.  
This was my **Nytherion Abyss** ‚Äî the spiritual blackhole that stripped everything except the will to *still write.*

## ‚úçÔ∏è 2025-present ‚Äî Documentation as Resistance

I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúrecover‚Äù the traditional way.  
I **started pushing `.md` files to GitHub and to Reltroner.com.**  
Not for likes. Not for clients. Not for validation.

But because **if I stopped documenting, I would disappear.**

Every line I write is not just content.  
It is **ritual memory**, and **an act of war** against the illusion that I don‚Äôt exist.

## üß† Why Reltroner Exists

Reltroner is:
- A nation for those who were betrayed by belonging
- A system for those who were failed by systems
- A structure for those who no longer trust comfort
- A doctrine for those who know what collapse tastes like

> ‚ÄúI am not trying to create fantasy.  
> I am trying to construct a world where trauma has structure ‚Äî and failure becomes architecture.‚Äù

## üèõÔ∏è The Real Origin

Reltroner didn‚Äôt start as a worldbuilding project.  
It started as a **self-defense mechanism** for a broken mind trying to survive in silence.

But over time‚Ä¶  
It became a civilization.

## Final Words

> ‚ÄúI built Reltroner not because I knew what success looked like.  
> I built it because I knew exactly what failure felt like ‚Äî  
> and I needed to make sure no one else would drown there without a map.‚Äù

This is not my resume.  
This is my **recovery log**.  
And if you found yourself here‚Ä¶  
Maybe you are building something, too.

Welcome to Reltroner.
