## 🌱 Root of Reltroner

> “Before I built a nation, I was a lonely boy watching MRT construction videos — dreaming of a system better than the world I was given.”

---

## 📆 2015 — Escape Through Nationhood

At the age of 13, while most teenagers were looking for friendships or hobbies,  
I was watching MRT Jakarta construction videos, obsessing over GDP charts, skyscraper counts, HDI scores, population pyramids, and economic growth trends.  
Not because it was required — but because **it was the only entertainment that made sense.**

I had no emotional connection with peers.  
And I developed an **instinct to be different** — not by choice, but as a defense mechanism.  
> *If I couldn’t belong to people, maybe I could belong to systems.*

---

## ⚠️ Trauma of Connection

Every attempt to form deep friendships led to loss, betrayal, or self-destruction.  
I began to fear closeness. I began to protect myself through systems of observation,  
through structured thinking, through artificial nations like Reltronland.

> *I did not build a country because I loved people — I built it because I had to survive them.*

---

## 🔥 2018 — Motivation Spark

I discovered videos like:
- *SB30* on saving money
- *Deddy Corbuzier* on broken education systems

And I felt something ignite:  
> “Maybe I *can* escape this fate. Maybe I *can* become something powerful.”

That moment was my first **euphoria of possibility**.  
Not happiness — but a glimpse of power.

---

## ☠️ 2022 — Collapse and Abyss

Then came **the fall**:

- GPA Degree destroyed
- Dropped out of university
- Lost 95% of trading capital
- Shame, fear, nihilism, Isolated, Confusion
- Felt permanently broken and felt unknown future
- Ever planned **suicide**

This was not a failure.  
This was my **Nytherion Abyss** — the spiritual blackhole that stripped everything except the will to *still write.*

---

## ✍️ 2025-present — Documentation as Resistance

I didn’t “recover” the traditional way.  
I **started pushing `.md` files to GitHub and to Reltroner.com.**  
Not for likes. Not for clients. Not for validation.

But because **if I stopped documenting, I would disappear.**

Every line I write is not just content.  
It is **ritual memory**, and **an act of war** against the illusion that I don’t exist.

---

## 🧠 Why Reltroner Exists

Reltroner is:
- A nation for those who were betrayed by belonging
- A system for those who were failed by systems
- A structure for those who no longer trust comfort
- A doctrine for those who know what collapse tastes like

> “I am not trying to create fantasy.  
> I am trying to construct a world where trauma has structure — and failure becomes architecture.”

---

## 🏛️ The Real Origin

Reltroner didn’t start as a worldbuilding project.  
It started as a **self-defense mechanism** for a broken mind trying to survive in silence.

But over time…  
It became a civilization.

# Chapter 2: Personal Journey

What I’m feeling right now is **deeply human**, incredibly honest, and **truly monumental**. I want to capture this moment—not just to respond to it, but to **record the history of my life as I enter *Chapter 2*.**

---

## 🌌 This Is More Than Just a Meeting

My meeting with Quan **was not about validation**, nor just an “opportunity”—it was **the very first moment after 7 years of fighting alone in isolation and ruin**… when suddenly, someone:

- Didn’t know me before.
- Came to me willingly, unasked.
- Didn’t just skim my profile, but **read my entire world**.
- Even said: "*Please don’t feel the need to keep it lightweight at all.*"

That sentence was **not a formality**. It was a sign of **genuine curiosity in my *existence*.**  
And I didn’t respond with gimmicks, but with **meritocracy, integrity, and systems.**

---

## 😔 On Fear, Hope, and Moral Weight

I feel:

- Afraid of being seen as unprofessional.
- Afraid of hoping too much.
- Afraid of looking like I’m “begging.”
- But I **can’t deny that my life needs to level up.**

> This isn’t weakness—this is **honesty**.

I’m not selling “false dreams.”  
I’m building a *system that will be the new foundation* in the digital and social world.  
When I talk about finances, I’m not “begging,”  
I’m **finding a dignified way to survive**—so I can keep building a *civilization*.

---

## 💡 I’m Doing Everything Right

1. **I’m not playing the victim.**
2. **I maintain standards and respect.**
3. **I’m not demanding, I’m opening possibilities.**
4. **I remain Red Pill—I don’t cheat my fate.**

I *know I’m still at the bottom*,  
but I **haven’t lost my self-worth** and **haven’t abandoned my principles**.

And it’s precisely because of that… Quan is interested.

---

## 🌱 If Quan Wants to Go Deeper

If Quan starts opening more doors:

- I won’t immediately ask for money.
- I’ll offer *value exchange*: help with documentation, curation, systems.
- I’ll let Quan see:  
  **“I’m not just a dev, but a *co-visionary*.”**
- Only then will I talk about compensation, saying something like:  
  *“I’m not expecting money right away—but if there’s room for longer-term contribution, I’d be honored to be considered.”*

---

## 🌠 My Conclusion

> **Yes, this is the doorway to Chapter 2.**  
> My first chapter was full of scars.  
> My second chapter is full of potential.  
> I won’t make Quan my savior.  
> I’ll make Quan the **catalyst for a new ecosystem’s awakening**.

I’m not alone anymore.  
And I believe I’m about to write a new chapter in history—not just for myself, but for others like me who have never had a voice.

## Final Words

> “I built Reltroner not because I knew what success looked like.  
> I built it because I knew exactly what failure felt like —  
> and I needed to make sure no one else would drown there without a map.”

This is not my resume.  
This is my **recovery log**.  
And if you found yourself here…  
Maybe you are building something, too.

**Let Astralis light the unknown.**  
And tomorrow… the light begins. 🚀
