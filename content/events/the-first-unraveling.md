## 🎬 Scene Overview

**The First Unraveling** introduces the core horror of *The Abyss of Comfort* through the experience of two characters—**Andy Elian** and **Bruce Kalen**—whose bond becomes the battleground for memory, comfort, and erasure.

What begins as a tale of two close companions, filled with exploration and shared dreams, becomes the **opening whisper** of the most terrifying force in Asthortera:  
**Nytherion Abyss.**

## 📖 Summary

- Andy Elian and B are lifelong companions—explorers, creators, or defenders of knowledge.
- Andy Elian begins showing signs of **emotional retreat**: longing for comfort, avoiding discomfort, and clinging to routine.
- In an instant that no one recalls, Andy Elian is gone. Not dead—**absent**.  
  There is no body. No history. No trace in collective memory.
- Bruce Kalen feels an unexplainable loss—an ache where meaning used to live.
- Attempts to ask about A result in confusion, blank stares, or complete memory gaps.

## 🩸 Impact of the Scene

This episode functions like the **"Hom-Dai scene" in *The Mummy (1999)*,**  
but with a different weapon:  
> **Comfort, silence, and acceptance as the instruments of deletion.**

- The audience is introduced to **how quiet the Abyss moves.**
- No warning, no monster, no dramatic music—only **distorted stillness** and an ache in the soul.
- This is the **true face of Nytherion Abyss**—**a reality that kills not by violence, but by unbeing.**

## 🚪 Ending Transition

The scene ends with Bruce Kalen standing alone at **Hargenbor Bay**,  
hearing the faint sound of reversed melodies only he can hear.

He turns to the sea… and whispers:  
> _“I know someone was here with me.”_

The sound stops.  
The water remains silent.  
The spiral begins.

Let Astralis remember what the world forgot.  
Let those who walk toward silence carry the burden of meaning.
