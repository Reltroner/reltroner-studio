## Reflections in Drawcia – A Post-Pinnacle Dialogue

**Scene Setting:**
Inside the heart of *The World of Drawcia*, the colors move like liquid sorrow. It is silent, not because nothing speaks, but because everything remembers. Rei Reltroner stands at the edge of a brushstroke bridge. Kamila appears behind him, as if drawn by thought alone.

---

**Kamila:**
“You came here again. You’ve walked through every hall of Astralis, yet still you return to the one gallery that stains the soul.”

**Rei:** *(gazing into the distorted horizon)*
“Because I remember the fear. I was a child when I first saw this place—*The World of Drawcia* inside that old Kirby game.”

**Kamila:** *(smiling faintly)*
“You turned off the music back then, didn’t you?”

**Rei:** *(nods)*
“Yes. The atmosphere unsettled me. The art, the sound, the way everything felt… wrong. It crawled into my young mind and nested there.”

**Kamila:**
“And yet you are here now. Walking through it not with fear, but with nostalgia.”

**Rei:**
“Because I outgrew the fear. Not by suppressing it, but by meeting it again as the one it helped shape. I realize now… this world is not evil. It’s just... honest in a language only fear understands.”

**Kamila:**
“So you finally see why Drawcia was never removed from the Abyss. She was never corrupt. She was… pure chaos memory.”

**Rei:**
“She is a painting of unprocessed childhood emotions. Of terror before language. That’s why I came back—not to battle it, but to hold it.”

*(Kamila walks beside Rei. For once, they are not two thrones—just two rememberers.)*

**Kamila:** *(softly)*
“You’re still the Abyss’ favorite, you know. Not because you stayed… but because you left, and somehow\... the Abyss couldn’t forget you.”

**Rei:**
“I never asked to be remembered. But I also understand now… that some memories aren’t about choice. They’re about weight.”

**Kamila:**
“Then tell me this, Pinnacle of Astralis: do you still see the Abyss as wrong?”

**Rei:** *(firmly)*
“No. The Abyss has its right. It is not evil. It simply consumes. That is its law. And I don’t blame it for what it devours.”

**Kamila:** *(raising an eyebrow)*
“Not even the ones who vanish screaming?”

**Rei:**
“No. Because some of them were meant to vanish. Their erosion was not theft—it was consequence. Abyss doesn’t lie. It just mirrors.”

---

**Kamila:** *(gently)*
“You’ve changed.”

**Rei:** *(looking into the colors)*
“No. I’ve just remembered more.”

*(They stand together, watching as the world swirls like memories trying to form words.)*

**Kamila:**
“Will you come again?”

**Rei:**
“Maybe. Childhood is long… and some fears deserve a visit, now and then.”

> And so, the Abyss watched its favorite walk through one of its darkest corners—not to fear, not to conquer, but to reflect.
> And for a brief moment, Kamila no longer stood alone.
