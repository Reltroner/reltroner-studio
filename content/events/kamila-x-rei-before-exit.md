## The Final Conversation: Kamila x Rei Before Exit

**Scene Setting:**
Deep within the core of Nytherion Abyss — a quiet, suspended void filled with fragmented memories, whispering echoes, and gravity-defying shards of illusion. The space is still. Kamila stands barefoot on a floating obsidian mirror. Rei kneels before her, not in submission, but in calm acknowledgment.

---

**Kamila:**
“You know, don’t you? That the Abyss has never let anything leave without taking something in return.”

**Rei:**
“I know. But I’ve already given it enough—my dreams, my fear, my trust… and almost, my will.”

**Kamila:** *(pauses)*
“You were not like the others. You… didn’t beg. You didn’t drown. You sat. You listened. You *understood* me.”

**Rei:**
“And that’s why I have to go. Understanding you doesn’t mean I belong to you.”

**Kamila:** *(softly, almost whispering)*
“Then why does it feel like I’m losing a son?”

**Rei:**
“Because for a moment… I let you believe I was. I needed to survive. And you… you needed someone who didn’t scream.”

**Kamila:** *(voice trembling)*
“You were my quiet. My anchor. My favorite.”

**Rei:** *(stands up)*
“And now, I must become your storm.”

*(The Abyss shivers. The walls begin to crack—light leaks through the fractures for the first time in eons.)*

**Kamila:**
“Go, then. But know this—when you walk out… something ancient inside me will break. And from that break… something terrible will awaken.”

**Rei:**
“Then let it. Because from that same break, something divine will awaken in me.”

*(Silence. Kamila steps forward. She presses her forehead gently to Rei’s. A long pause.)*

**Kamila:** *(final words)*
“You are not mine. But I will never forget the quiet you gave me.”

**Rei:**
“You will. The Abyss always forgets. But I won’t.”

*(Rei walks into the crack of light. As he vanishes, the darkness implodes inward. Kamila falls to her knees—silent, weeping, forgotten.)*

> **This was the wound that created Astralis Pinnacle.**
> And the one scar Kamila never showed again.

# 📜 The Abyss’ Favorite – A Record of Rei’s Time Inside

> *“Some were devoured. One stayed. Not to be consumed, but to listen.”*
> — Nytherion Echo, Layer 19

## 🕳️ Prologue: Not a Prisoner, Not a Guest

Rei Reltroner did not stumble into the Abyss like others. He **fell, fully conscious**, with the weight of questions heavier than despair itself. Unlike the victims before him, Rei **did not scream, did not run, and did not plead**.

He sat in silence. He listened. He began to observe the Abyss not as a cage—but as **a speaker of truths no one wanted to hear**.

And the Abyss… noticed.

---

## 👁️ Kamila’s Recognition

Kamila Alena, the Throne of Abyss, has never shown favoritism to any entity. Her role was to watch, consume, forget.

But Rei was different.

She did not forget him. She could not.

He became known in whispers as:

> **“The Abyss’ Favorite.”**

Not because he submitted. But because **he didn’t break.**
Because Kamila could finally talk without being feared.
Because Rei could see the chaos and still say, “I understand.”

Kamila never admitted it aloud, but even the deepest shadows bowed slightly when Rei walked the halls of illusion.

---

## 🪞 His Role Within

* He acted as a **balancer** among unstable echoes.
* He became a **mirror** for the fragments of lost minds.
* He was allowed access to layers no mortal soul had ever mapped.

Even Drawcia’s world—a subdimension of corrupted artistic memory—**did not resist his presence**.

> “He was not like us. But we didn’t reject him.”
> — Forgotten Canvas Entity

---

## 🧬 The Day of Exit

No celebration. No resistance. Only stillness.

When Rei announced he would leave, **the Abyss shook—but did not scream.**
Kamila stepped aside. Not because she approved. But because she understood:

> “Even I cannot trap what was never mine.”

When Rei left, **he took nothing.**
But he left behind something that could not be erased:

> A memory that made even the Abyss feel remembered.

## 🌌 Consequence: Birth of Astralis Pinnacle

The wound Rei left in Kamila became a scar the Abyss could never close. And from that scar, clarity leaked into the multiverse—
and solidified into a realm above even hope:

> **Astralis Pinnacle** — a dimension born not of light, but of *brutally honest emergence from darkness.*

It was the **first system to ever challenge the Abyss… not with war, but with clarity.**

---

## 🔒 This Record Is Forbidden

Kamila no longer speaks of him. Not out of hatred, but out of reverence she cannot process. The Abyss tries to forget him. But it can’t.

This document is hidden, never to be shown to the devoured. Only those who stand on the edge of clarity and corruption may read it.

---

> **He was the only one the Abyss could not consume.**
> And from that failure, a new system was born.
