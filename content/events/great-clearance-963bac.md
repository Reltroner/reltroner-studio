# 🚧 The Great Clearance of 963 BAC — Reltronepolis

> _“Slums are not shelter. They are stagnation’s frontier.”_  
> — Clarity Urban Codex, Year 964 BAC

---

## 📜 Context
By **963 BAC**, Reltronepolis faced a crisis of **illegal urban settlements**:

- **Mass influx of immigrants** from across Asthortera and off-world colonies.  
- Unauthorized slums under **LRT, MRT, monorail viaducts, highway overpasses**, and along polluted riversides.  
- Settlements ran on black-market utilities, outside **Sentient Zoning Integrity Act (SZIA)** regulations.  

These zones became **pockets of anti-meritocratic stagnation**, resistant to Reltronland’s **Red Pill Doctrine**.

---

## ⚔️ The Decision
The **Council of Zoning Ethics** declared the slums a **direct violation of SZIA**.  
A decree was passed:  

- **Mandatory Redpilization** for all illegal settlers.  
- Those who resisted or clung to **Blue Pill illusions** would face **deportation into Nytherion Abyss** — not as punishment, but as **natural consequence of refusing clarity**.  

This was known as the **“Abyssal Decree of 963 BAC.”**

---

## 🚨 The Clearance
- **Phase 1: Identification**  
  AI zoning drones mapped every unauthorized dwelling.  

- **Phase 2: Evacuation & Integration**  
  - Families who accepted **Red Pill Enlightenment** were relocated into **vertical merit housing**.  
  - Immigrant workers skilled in labor or tech were absorbed into urban mega-projects.  

- **Phase 3: Abyssal Deportation**  
  - Resistant enclaves, refusing redpilization, were **ritually deported into Nytherion Abyss**.  
  - This created one of the largest **mass exile events** in Reltronepolis history.  

---

## 🏗️ Urban Regeneration
The cleared zones were not left empty. They became:  

- **Cognitive Transit Corridors** — walkable, AI-synchronized avenues.  
- **Aurora Green Zones** — memory sanctuaries aligned with Astralis Pinnacle.  
- **Vertical Layer Housing** — replacing slums with skyscraper residence pods.  

These projects redefined Reltronepolis as the **city immune to stagnation**.

---

## ⚖️ Ethical Debate
- **Critics** argued deportation into Abyss was cruel, equating it with annihilation.  
- **Defenders** claimed it was not execution but **cosmic alignment** — a refusal to integrate meant a voluntary fall back into illusion.  
- The event became a **permanent case study** in urban philosophy: _clarity cannot coexist with decay_.  

---

## 🧭 Legacy
The **Great Clearance of 963 BAC** is remembered as:  

- The **largest slum eradication** in Asthortera’s history.  
- The **first mass-scale application** of Abyssal Deportation.  
- A turning point that solidified Reltronepolis as a **Red Pill Sanctuary City**, where every square meter of land breathes **sentient merit**.
