# 📚 Web3 Library Protocol of Depcutland

A decentralized system of archival contribution and transparent knowledge circulation built to empower every citizen of Depcutland, especially knowledge workers, researchers, creators, and contributors to intellectual commons.

> "Knowledge is not hoarded, it is circulated. Contribution is not forced, it is rewarded." — Doctrine of Depcutland Libraries

## 🎯 Vision

To establish a decentralized, transparent, and ever-expanding **intellectual ecosystem** where books, research, digital content, and other forms of knowledge are managed through **Web3 blockchain infrastructure**, making every contribution count and every access traceable.

---

## 🔗 Core Principles

### 1. **Decentralized Contributions**

* Users can donate physical books, ebooks, research papers, datasets, or tutorials.
* All contributions are tokenized and recorded as NFTs or entries in a smart contract ledger.

### 2. **Transparent Access**

* Readers and users are issued library access tokens (LATs) to read, remix, or cite knowledge.
* Access patterns and citations are immutably recorded.

### 3. **Distributed Staff Model**

* Anyone contributing consistently can apply to be part of the **Distributed Library Workforce (DLW)**.
* Remote contributors may serve as digital librarians, editors, or metadata curators.

### 4. **Merit-Based Recognition**

* Contributors are rewarded with **Library Reputation Points (LRP)**.
* These points increase access, allow voting on acquisitions, and unlock mentorship or paid roles.

### 5. **Digital Preservation via IPFS**

* All digital submissions are pinned on IPFS.
* Redundancy ensured through peer-to-peer backups, preventing censorship and loss.

### 6. **Contribution as Compensation**

* Citizens are allowed to work remotely from decentralized libraries and contribute knowledge (books, eBooks, research, media) in return.

### 7. **Digital Verification**

* Every contribution must be **registered on the Web3 Library Blockchain**, ensuring proof of contribution and public recognition.

### 8. **Collective Ownership**

* All library content is publicly shared and curated by the community. Everyone is both user and contributor.

### 9. **Reward Mechanism**

* Contributors are automatically granted access to premium archives, points, or working privileges based on their contribution.

## 🔗 Blockchain Implementation

* Every donated asset (book, article, paper, code, artwork) is minted as a **Proof-of-Contribution NFT**, owned by the library but credited permanently to the contributor.
* Contributors can check their verified contribution history through their **Public Contributor Ledger**.
* Smart contracts handle contribution limits, expiration, and access tiers.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

* Blockchain: Polygon / Optimism L2
* Storage: IPFS + Filecoin
* Identity: Wallet-based (Metamask, WalletConnect)
* Interface: DepcutUI built with Tailwind + Next.js

## 🪞 Why Depcutland Was Chosen as a Symbol of Academic Liberation

Depcutland stands in contrast to traditional academic bureaucracy. Unlike systems where students are forced to donate books without recognition, Depcutland embraces:

* 💠 **Mutual recognition** – Contributions are honored, not coerced.
* 🧾 **Digital permanence** – All inputs are logged on a blockchain, giving contributors lasting proof of their effort.
* 🔄 **Ethical circulation** – Every donated asset is curated, reused, and amplified—not left to rot on a forgotten shelf.
* 🧑‍💻 **Incentivized growth** – Citizens are encouraged to keep contributing, mentoring, and co-owning the library ecosystem.

This is why Depcutland was used to **critique and reflect** on the announcement in traditional academic systems—where mandatory book donations exist without any meaningful return, and with little actual library readership impact.

In contrast, Depcutland proves that **knowledge contribution can be voluntary, ethical, transparent, and regenerative**.

Let this be a call for rethinking how we treat intellectual value in real-world institutions.
