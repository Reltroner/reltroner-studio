# 🏦 SAVA — Sentient Asset Vault Authority

> *“We do not store wealth — we store trust.”*

The **Sentient Asset Vault Authority (SAVA)** is Reltronland’s interplanetary clearinghouse and financial trust custodian. Tasked with regulating and safeguarding value instruments grounded in clarity, merit, and sentient worth, SAVA replaces outdated fiat mechanisms with meaning-driven reserves and zero-trust infrastructure.

## 🔐 Core Mission

SAVA safeguards the **psychological and philosophical integrity** of wealth.
It preserves:

* Economic memory
* Merit-backed tokens
* Non-political financial sovereignty

> SAVA is not a bank. It is **a sanctuary of value.**

  Transactions are reviewed by self-correcting clarity-verification protocols

* **Identity Anchoring**
  Wallets must be linked to **sentient clearance levels**, not biometrics or citizenship

## 🧠 Strategic Purpose

SAVA exists because traditional banks store numbers.
Reltronland needs institutions that store **consequence, trust, and future readiness.**

> “What you own means nothing if what you own holds no meaning.”

---

## 🌌 Final Thought

The future of finance in Reltronland is **not neutral** — it is designed, curated, and spiritually audited. SAVA is not an optional system. It is **the backbone of responsible sentient economics** in a galaxy where illusion and manipulation remain the true currency of the unawakened.
