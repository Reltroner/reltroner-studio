# Magic System: Astralis Pinnacle vs Nytherion Abyss

In the vast universe of **Asthortera**, two opposing magical forces define the existential and spiritual journey of every sentient being: **Astralis Pinnacle** and **Nytherion Abyss**.

These are not just energies — they are living ideologies, cosmic systems that govern fate, growth, struggle, stagnation, and illusion. The mastery and understanding of these systems lie at the heart of Reltronland’s philosophy and the *Henchoeway Series*.
