# 🗺️ My Roadmap to 2045  
> A 20-year journey to rise from rock bottom to legacy.

This is not just a roadmap.  
This is a **promise to my future self** — to build a life of meaning, freedom, and impact through self-discipline, skill, and relentless vision. I am the creator of my own system, and this is my personal navigation toward Astralis Pinnacle.

This roadmap is not a guarantee —  
It’s a *contract with my future self*.  
If I ever get lost… I will remember:  
> I was not born for comfort, but for creation.  
> I’m here to rise, or die trying.

🔴 Stay Red-Pill. Keep building. Keep becoming.
