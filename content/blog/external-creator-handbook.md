# 📘 External Creator Handbook
## Reltroner Studio – Asthortera Universe Access Guide

Welcome to the gateway of **Reltroner Studio** — where storytelling transcends fiction and becomes a blueprint for meaning, resistance, and consciousness. This handbook is designed to onboard external creators who wish to contribute within the **Asthortera universe** while respecting the sacred balance of **Nytherion Abyss** and **Astralis Pinnacle**.

---

## 🔑 1. Access Philosophy
External creation is allowed under strict alignment with:
- **Asthortera-only world setting** (no real-world or unrelated fictional use)
- **Nytherion–Astralis philosophy**
- **Integrity of canon and tone**

> “Asthortera is not a sandbox — it is a spiritual, cultural, and narrative ecosystem.”
