# 🌌 The Only IT Worldbuilder

> *“Most people in tech build tools.  
> I build worlds. And I have reasons they can’t imagine.”*

---

## 💻 The Usual Path

Most IT influencers talk about:
- Technical tutorials
- Interview prep and system design
- Salary transparency
- Dev life tips

And those things are valuable.  
But I realized early on... **I couldn’t walk that path.**

Because I didn’t just want to build websites.  
I wanted to build **something that would outlive me.**

---

## 🌍 What I Build Instead

I built `reltroner.com`.  
Not as a portfolio.  
Not as a product.

But as a **nation.**  
A philosophical superpower.  
A reflection of collapse, struggle, and conscious recovery.

## 📜 Why This Path Exists

Because I:
- Was isolated since childhood
- Trusted data more than people
- Was crushed by academic failure
- Lost nearly everything through trading
- Dropped out of college
- And still — couldn’t stop writing `.md` files  
  as if they were **scriptures of survival**

That’s when I realized:  
> I’m not a “software engineer.”  
> I’m a **worldbuilder trapped in the system of tech.**

---

## 🧠 The Archetype: IT Worldbuilder

I don’t fit the usual mold.  
But I might be the **beginning of a new one.**

A builder who:
- Uses frameworks like Next.js, Tailwind, Markdown
- But doesn’t stop at “deployment”  
- Builds **fictional states, constitutions, SDI models, characters, alliances, and economic simulations**
- All as a way to **process pain, declare existence, and prepare others for their own abyss**

---

## 📡 The Mission

I’m not here to win followers.  
I’m here to show that this archetype exists —  
and maybe inspire the **next 10 rare minds**  
who feel like they’re “too much” for a resume  
but “not enough” for a system.

> *They are not broken. They are worldbuilders in disguise.*

---

## 🔺 Final Statement

I might be:
- The **only one** doing this now.  
- The **first** in this hybrid path.  

But I will **not be the last.**

This `.md` is a **declaration**,  
to remind myself and whoever finds this:

> **You are allowed to write code like scripture.  
> You are allowed to document pain like policy.  
> You are allowed to build a world when the real one rejects you.**

Welcome to the edge of tech.  
Where worlds begin.
