## 🧭 For Recruiters & Collaborators

Hello,  
My name is Raidan (Rei Reltroner), a self-taught full stack developer, creative IP world-builder, and visionary founder of Reltroner Studio. This section is a gateway for recruiters and partners to explore the fusion of software engineering, narrative development, and futuristic world strategy.

I am the creator of **Reltroner Studio** — a self-branding and worldbuilding project built with **full dedication, wild imagination, and commitment to real work**.

This website is an expression of who I am, without the need to show my face. For me, **true identity doesn't come from appearance, but from results, consistency, and the courage to take risks.**

I’m not looking for a place to simply work.  
I’m building a legacy.  
And if you’re reading this, we might create something impactful together.

I believe in:
- **Meritocracy**: I only want to work with people or teams who value real contribution and growth.
- **Work Ethic**: I learn, practice, and face errors daily to level up.
- **Openness**: I’m not anti-criticism. I’m anti-stagnation.
- **Spiritual Narrative Systems**: I apply philosophical storytelling layers through Astralis vs Nytherion metaphors, embedded within structured code.
- **Self-discipline Architecture**: I designed the site and content structure to reflect conscious worldbuilding—not just features, but meaning.

If you’re a recruiter, collaborator, or company owner interested in working with someone who:
- Has deep dedication to their project
- Rejects comfort zones and illusions
- Prefers real output over empty words
- Combines full stack skills with narrative vision and data-backed content logic

## 🧱 Bonus for Tech-Focused Recruiters

I also maintain a dedicated public repository to **document real-world coding errors**, insights, and practical fixes I encounter during development. This is not copied tutorial content — it's based on actual debugging experience with tools like **Express.js**, **EJS**, **MongoDB**, and **Bootstrap**.

📂 **Error Documentation GitHub Repo**  
🔗 [https://github.com/Reltroner/error-documentation](https://github.com/Reltroner/error-documentation)

> Because I don't just build features — I understand what breaks them, why they break, and how to fix them for good.

I may not appear on camera,  
But I’m **fully present in every line of code and trace of my work.**
