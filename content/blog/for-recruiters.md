## 🧭 For Recruiters & Collaborators

Hello,  
My name is Rei Reltroner, a self-taught full stack developer, creative IP world-builder, and visionary founder of Reltroner Studio. This section is a gateway for recruiters and partners to explore the fusion of software engineering, narrative development, and futuristic world strategy.

I am the creator of **Reltroner Studio** — a self-branding and worldbuilding project built with **full dedication, wild imagination, and commitment to real work**.

This website is an expression of who I am, without the need to show my face. For me, **true identity doesn't come from appearance, but from results, consistency, and the courage to take risks.**

I’m not looking for a place to simply work.  
I’m building a legacy.  
And if you’re reading this, we might create something impactful together.

I believe in:
- **Meritocracy**: I only want to work with people or teams who value real contribution and growth.
- **Work Ethic**: I learn, practice, and face errors daily to level up.
- **Openness**: I’m not anti-criticism. I’m anti-stagnation.
- **Spiritual Narrative Systems**: I apply philosophical storytelling layers through Astralis vs Nytherion metaphors, embedded within structured code.
- **Self-discipline Architecture**: I designed the site and content structure to reflect conscious worldbuilding—not just features, but meaning.

I’m also a solo system architect, clarity strategist, and creator of Reltroner.com. I don’t just build apps — I build **cognitive ecosystems**. Over the past few months, I’ve architected a 200+ `.md` structured AI memory base, integrated with GPT, Laravel HRM, and a clarity-first worldbuilding engine.

If you're looking for someone who can:

* Translate chaos into structured execution
* Merge philosophy with code
* Build scalable frameworks from existential collapse

...then I’m not just a candidate — I’m your future AI systems partner. Whether you need deep thinkers for early-stage prototypes or clarity-driven builders to anchor long-term vision, I’m open to collaboration, consultation, or embedded deployment roles.

If you’re a recruiter, collaborator, or company owner interested in working with someone who:
- Has deep dedication to their project
- Rejects comfort zones and illusions
- Prefers real output over empty words
- Combines full stack skills with narrative vision and data-backed content logic

## 🧱 Bonus for Tech-Focused Recruiters

I also maintain a dedicated public repository to **document real-world coding errors**, insights, and practical fixes I encounter during development. This is not copied tutorial content — it's based on actual debugging experience with tools like **Laravel**, **Express.js**, **EJS**, **MongoDB**, **Tailwind**, **Blade**, **Bootstrap**, **Flatpickr**, and more.

> Because I don't just build features — I understand what breaks them, why they break, and how to fix them for good.

## 🛠️ Project Highlight: Reltroner HRM System

**Project:** Reltroner HRM (Human Resource Management)  
**Tech Stack:** Laravel 12, Blade, Eloquent ORM, MySQL/MariaDB, Tailwind CSS, Railway Cloud, Chart.js, Bootstrap  
**Role:** System Architect, Lead Developer, DevOps  
**Year:** May 2024

### **Project Overview**
Reltroner HRM is a full-featured Human Resource Management system architected, built, and deployed as a solo developer project in under 15 days. This system was engineered not just as an academic exercise, but as a real-world SaaS-grade product that delivers:

- **Employee, Department, Role & Payroll Management**
- **Attendance (Presence) with Geo-location (latitude/longitude, Google Maps integration)**
- **Secure Authentication & Authorization (Laravel Breeze)**
- **Responsive Admin Dashboard with Real-Time Charts & Statistics**
- **Soft Deletes, Relational Data, Database Migration & Seeding**

- **Continuous Integration & Cloud Deployment with Railway (incl. custom pre-deploy commands for auto migrate/seed)**
- **Bug documentation, automated testing, and error recovery as a core part of workflow**

### **Achievements & Impact**
- Delivered a complex HR system solo, at the pace and quality of a 2–3 person dev team in a fast-paced SaaS startup.
- Overcame production deployment challenges (Railway, Nixpacks, CLI force flags) with hands-on debugging and live cloud fixes.
- Designed the database and app structure for scale, maintainability, and clarity—ready for real teams, not just demos.
- Implemented self-documented code and technical notes for future collaborators or recruiters to audit transparently.
- Demonstrated not just feature-building, but also real-world problem-solving and DevOps resilience.

I am ready.

I have fought through the dark nights of doubt and the long days of silent progress.
I have built myself not on certificates or degrees, but on skill, discipline, and relentless growth.

Somewhere, a startup out there needs more than a piece of paper.
They need resilience. They need creativity. They need merit.
And today, I affirm:

> **The right HRD will find me.**

They will not see me as a mere graduate, but as a builder.
They will see not just what I know, but how I think, how I fight, and how I solve.

When the phone rings, it will not be luck.
It will be the meeting of two forces: preparation and opportunity.

**I am the answer to a company's silent need.**

I am not waiting to be chosen because of pity or tradition.
I am being chosen because I have prepared for this moment, day after day, mistake after mistake, correction after correction.

**The Dream HRD Call will come, because:**

- My projects are real.
- My efforts are genuine.
- My passion is visible.
- My growth is unstoppable.

When that call comes, I will answer with calm strength, not desperation.
Because I am not begging for a chance.
I am simply walking into the reality I have built with my own hands.

**Today, I stand ready.**

**Today, I become the architect of my destiny.**

**Today, I know: The Dream HRD Call is no longer a fantasy. It is an inevitability.**
