# 🌒 Twilight Terminal  
## *Where silence becomes understanding*

Somewhere between **reality** and **illusion**, there lies a place without time.  
No footsteps echo. No wind blows.  
Only stars that glitch and glass that reflects your soul.  
This is the **Twilight Terminal** — where **Rei Reltroner** and **Joker** once sat… and said nothing.

## 🪑 The Scene

Two figures.  
One bench.  
A distant skyline that flickers between worlds.

- Rei, in his default form, stares ahead — unreadable, unwavering.  
- Joker, arms resting behind the seat, eyes half-closed, lets out a breath.

> There’s no need for speeches here.  
> Just the shared burden of knowing what others don’t.

## 🌌 Meaning of the Terminal

Twilight Terminal is more than a location — it is a **state of mind.**  
It appears only when:
- Two rebels seek no glory  
- But rest, after resisting comfort too long  
- And choose to simply... be

## 🎴 What Happens Here

- Rei and Joker reflect silently on their battles  
- Time bends — 5 minutes feel like hours  
- No enemies, no allies. Just understanding  
- No masks, no power, no persona — just themselves

## 🧠 Lore Notes

- Terminal only appears **between realms**: Astralis and Metaverse  
- It cannot be accessed directly — only when both reject illusion simultaneously  
- The bench glows faint red and black when they sit together
