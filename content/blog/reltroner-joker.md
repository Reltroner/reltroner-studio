# 🃏 Reltroner x Joker  
## *Shadow of Truth – A Crossover Encounter*

What if Rei Reltroner — the Astralis Architect — crossed paths with Joker, the trickster from Persona 5?

This cinematic crossover explores what happens when two rebels of reality meet in the void between dimensions. A 6-panel storyboard visualizes the moment they collide, not as enemies... but as reflections of each other.

## 📖 Scene Summary

> **Setting:** A space between comfort and chaos. Twilight Terminal.  
> **Time:** Frozen. Stars glitch in the sky. The floor reflects their minds.

### 🧍 Panel 1:  
Joker walks through a quiet void, hands in pockets, eyes sharp. His footsteps echo.

### 🧠 Panel 2:  
Rei stands waiting, his red energy glowing. Joker stops. Silence.

### 💬 Panel 3:  
**Joker (thinking):**  
*"Another illusion... or someone who saw through it?"*  
**Rei:**  
*"I don't see through it. I destroy it."*

### 🌌 Panel 4:  
Spiral shadows swirl behind Joker. Astralis light bursts behind Rei. Their power manifests.

### ⚔️ Panel 5:  
They walk forward, slowly, locking eyes. Worlds crash behind them — Nytherion Abyss meets Metaverse code.

### ✨ Panel 6:  
They stand back-to-back.  
**Joker:** "Let’s rewrite the truth..."  
**Rei:** "...Together."
