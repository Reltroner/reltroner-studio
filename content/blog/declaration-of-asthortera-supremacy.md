# 🌌 Declaration of Asthortera's Supremacy

## 📜 Preamble

We, the sentient civilizations of Asthortera, standing upon the pillars of clarity, self-mastery, and disciplined growth, hereby proclaim our ascension beyond the ancient limitations of chaos, stagnation, and delusion.

In unity of mind, body, and spirit, we affirm that supremacy is not given by domination, but earned through sentient awakening, meritocratic advancement, and the relentless pursuit of cosmic understanding.
