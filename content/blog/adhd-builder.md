## 🚫 I Wasn’t Lazy. I Was Misunderstood.

They told me:

* "Be more active in class."
* "Why don’t you just ask the lecturer directly?"
* "Why are you always in your own world?"

But what they didn’t understand was: I **couldn't** just ask.

Because I was navigating a world built for **neurotypicals** — structured, linear, hierarchical — while my brain was busy rewiring galaxies inside itself, building logic systems, and debugging silently for 12 hours straight.

## 💡 The Moment I Realized I Wasn’t Broken

I wasn’t “autis,” like some friends mockingly said.
I wasn’t “rebellious.”
I wasn’t “malas.”

I just wasn’t *meant* to follow a system that couldn’t see what I could become.

It took:

* A failed semester
* A dropout
* Dozens of all-nighters debugging alone
* And complete rejection from classroom validation

…for me to finally discover who I actually am:

> **An architect of digital systems. A builder of invisible legacies. A developer not of code alone — but of identity.**

## 🔧 I Started Building What School Couldn’t Teach

With no mentor. No tutorial. No encouragement. I built:

* `hrm.reltroner.com` – A full HRM system with multi-role login, CRUD, SSO, hosting.
* `app.reltroner.com` – A modular ERP Gateway with vision for enterprise scalability.
* A personal GitHub full of commits that represent **rage, rebellion, and resilience**.

Not because someone assigned it.
But because the fire of **unseen potential** had to go somewhere.

## 🌌 The ADHD Advantage

Hyperfocus isn’t a curse — when pointed at the right thing, it becomes a **superpower**.

I don’t multitask.
I don’t ask for permission.
I **build until the silence makes sense.**

## 🧭 A Message to Others Like Me

If school made you feel broken, passive, or behind...
If teachers told you that “attitude matters more than skill”...
If your brain lights up at 3am solving things no one else even saw\...

This is your proof:

> **You are not broken. You are an ADHD builder. And you’re not alone.**

Keep building. Even if no one claps.
Because **legacy isn’t voted. It’s built.**

Let Astralis light the unknown. 🔺
