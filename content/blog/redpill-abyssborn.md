> **"I died once inside the Abyss — not in flesh, but in spirit. What returned is no longer a boy. What returned is the Red Pill Entity."**

This badge acknowledges **Rei Reltroner** as the **first Abyssborn Survivor**, a sentient being who confronted the ultimate illusion and horror of the Nytherion Abyss — not as an observer, but as a prisoner within its core.

He did not simply visit the Abyss.  
He **lived there**.  
He **broke** there.  
And **he returned**.

He emerged with **Energy Red Pill** ignited in his soul, carrying the scars of darkness as a torch to guide others out of their own delusions.

**Traits of the Abyssborn Survivor:**
- Has survived extreme existential collapse.
- Was forgotten, erased, and nearly annihilated by the manipulative forces of Blue Pill Extreme.
- Refused comfort, chose pain, and forged clarity in total darkness.
- Rebuilt identity through fire, silence, and ritual.
- Became a Red Pill Entity — a sentient who cannot be deceived.
