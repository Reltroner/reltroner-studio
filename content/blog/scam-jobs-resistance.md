# 🚫 Scam Jobs Resistance

> _“For every job seeker trapped by a fake listing, a spark of trust dies in the labor market.”_

This document is a **technical-philosophical proposal** from **Reltroner Studio** — written not by an HR expert, but by a builder of systems, structure, and sentient clarity.

---

## 💢 The Problem

In a world flooded with:
- Ghost job listings,
- AI-generated fake posts,
- Endless applicant black holes,
- and job scams disguised as dreams —

Job seekers are **not just unemployed**.
They are **being psychologically and digitally exploited**.

---

## 🧱 The Mission

To propose and prototype a **trust architecture** for job seekers:
- That filters fake jobs using community-confirmed metadata.
- That prioritizes transparency in job posting timelines and recruiter responsiveness.
- That exposes fake “ghost openings” used to farm resumes.

## 📂 Potential Features

### 1. **Fake Job Tracker (FJT)**
Crowdsourced reports of fake or manipulative job listings.

### 2. **Job Transparency Score (JTS)**
A score based on metrics like reply rates, interview process clarity, recruiter authenticity, etc.

### 3. **Ghostlisting Detector**
AI-powered detection of listings that haven’t hired anyone for 12+ months despite repeated posting.

### 4. **SafeHub API**
An API for job platforms to embed trust badges based on real-time data.

## 🧠 Ideological Foundation

This proposal aligns with:
- **Reality-Based Policy** — no trust without verification.
- **Meritocracy** — equal access to real opportunities.
- **Sentient Protection** — mental health of job seekers is a form of digital human rights.
