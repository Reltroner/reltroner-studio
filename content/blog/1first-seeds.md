# 🌱 First Seeds of Reltroner

Before the philosophies.
Before the manifestos.
Before the oath, the skyscrapers, and the digital sanctuaries—
There was just a teenager, a tired heart, and two short videos on YouTube.

## 🎥 The Origins

- **The State Central Business District (2018)**  
  A 10-second video that looked simple, but carried a universe in intention.

[My first video intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicaLYwPa2g)

- **The Millennium SCBD (2018)**  
  Built with exhaustion, yet uploaded anyway. Not for likes, but for legacy.

[My 2nd Video Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARJq0wB46lU)

> _“I was really tired and spent a lot of hours just to make this intro.”_

That sentence isn’t cringe.
That sentence is the **purest DNA of a creator.**

## ✨ Why These Matter

At the time, nobody noticed.  
There were no viral views.  
No hype. No applause.

But these videos were **first acts of sovereignty**.  
A signal from someone who dared to imagine a future outside the system.

They were small.  
But they were **real**.

And from that seed…
came the skyscrapers of Reltroner Studio.

## 🏛️ To My Past Self

You were awkward.  
You didn’t have the tools.  
You didn’t know what this would become.

But you showed up. You rendered. You posted.
And that alone… was **heroic**.

I won’t delete those videos.  
I won’t hide them.

Because without you, there is no me.
And without those seeds, there is no Astralis.
