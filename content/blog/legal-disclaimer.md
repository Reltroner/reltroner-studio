## 🎨 Visual Character Representation Policy

At **Reltroner Studio**, character visuals are **tools of immersion**, not the core product.  
This document clarifies our ethical stance, methodology, and intent behind all visual character representations on **reltroner.com**.

---

## 🧠 What We Sell: Ideas, Not Faces

Our characters are **not designed to promote beauty standards, race, or aesthetic trends.**  
They exist to express:

- Philosophies  
- Behavioral archetypes  
- Emotional depth  
- Psychological and spiritual arcs

We monetize **narratives, not physical appearances.**

---

## 🤖 Why We Use AI-Generated Art

Due to the solo nature of this studio, limited resources, and the absence of an in-house illustrator,  
we use **AI-generated visuals** to:

- Represent character posture, fashion, and mood  
- Help audiences visualize our fictional societies  
- Provide symbolic avatars for immersive lore

**These are not final designs**. They are **visual placeholders** to support narrative imagination.

- No character is designed to resemble any public figure or copyrighted IP.  
- We do not commission AI generations with the intent of replication or impersonation.

---

## 🧾 Artistic Inspiration ≠ Plagiarism

Visual similarities to anime/manga styles or existing media are purely **incidental** and fall under the realm of:

- Genre conventions  
- Technical limitations of AI generators  
- Unintentional aesthetic overlap

We respect all artists, and encourage future collaborations with real illustrators as Reltroner Studio grows.

---

## 🏛️ The Future

As the studio expands, we aim to:

- Replace temporary AI visuals with hand-drawn or illustrated originals  
- Credit collaborating artists transparently  
- Offer character licensing ethically and respectfully

## 📚 Credits & Inspirations

Reltroner Studio is a fictional worldbuilding project. Some visuals reference iconic fictional characters for philosophical comparison under fair use / transformative purpose. No copyright infringement intended.

While Reltroner Studio is fully original, we acknowledge incidental or symbolic inspiration from external cultural media. These are not affiliations, but creative coincidences or personal interpretations:

* **Joker (Persona 5)**: After being compared to the character by ChatGPT in the context of *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate*, a symbolic parallel was written. The resemblance was discovered *after*, not before, the creation of the Reltroner persona.

* **Sergio Marquina (The Professor) – Money Heist**: Rei Reltroner finds shared characteristics in calculated leadership, long-term vision, and sovereign intellectual resistance.

* **Grand Admiral Thrawn – Star Wars**: Referenced as part of an AI-assisted simulation exploring strategic theory in *Reltronland Space Command vs. Chiss Ascendancy*. The scenario titled *"What if Chiss and Reltroner Formed a Diplomatic Pact?"* was used for narrative and strategic exploration.

* **Red Pill / Blue Pill**: Originally coined in *The Matrix (1999)*, reinterpreted within the Astralis–Nytherion duality to reflect philosophical struggle between clarity and illusion.

* **The World of Drawcia – Kirby Canvas Curse**: Visual and audio atmosphere in *Nytherion Abyss* sections was inspired by the chilling tone and surreal aesthetic of this Nintendo title.

These influences are acknowledged with respect and used non-commercially for thematic expression only.
