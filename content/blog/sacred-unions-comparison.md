## 🧭 Why Their Love Transcends the Screen

Rei and Raina are not lovers created for fan service.  
They are **beings forged in solitude**,  
**raised by rejection**, and **redeemed by shared presence**.  
Their love is not entertainment.  
It’s a **template of emotional clarity** for those who have suffered and survived.

> **"They do not fall in love—they awaken together."**

## 🕊️ Final Note to Readers

This comparison is not a rejection of romantic stories,

and affection is not obligation.

Rei & Raina teach us this:

> _Love isn’t what saves us. Love is what we become after we’ve saved ourselves._
