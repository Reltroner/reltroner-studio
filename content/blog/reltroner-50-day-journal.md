## 🧭 Purpose of this Journal

This journal exists as a **spiritual witness**.  
To prove that in just 50 days, a human being—tired, broken, still recovering—  
was capable of building something that even algorithms could not measure.

Reltroner.com is not a startup.  
It is not just a blog.  
It is a **living archive of awakening**.
