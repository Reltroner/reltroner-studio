# Pi Day Celebration

Happy Pi Day!

To celebrate this mathematical holiday, I've put together a fun page with some interesting facts and activities related to Pi.

### Fun Facts

* Pi is an irrational number, which means it can't be expressed as a finite decimal or fraction.
* Pi is approximately equal to 3.14159, but it's a transcendental number, which means it's not a root of any polynomial equation with rational coefficients, and its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating.
* Pi is a universal constant, meaning that it appears in many areas of mathematics, science, and engineering.
* Pi has been calculated to over 31.4 trillion digits using advanced computer algorithms and mathematical techniques.

### Activities

* Try calculating Pi yourself using one of the many algorithms available online.
* Create a Pi-themed art project using a circle or a spiral.
* Bake a pie (or a pizza) and celebrate with a slice (or a slice of pizza).
* Learn about the history of Pi and how it has been calculated throughout history.
