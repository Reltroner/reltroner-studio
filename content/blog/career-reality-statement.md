## 📄 Career Reality Statement

> “It’s not about lacking skills.  
> It’s about surviving a broken system.”

### ⚙️ My Current Condition

- 🎓 Studied Information Systems (with academic turbulence)
- 💼 No full-time job yet
- 💻 Actively building [Reltroner.com](https://reltroner.com)
- 💰 Low cash left for survival
- 🔋 Currently in energy recovery mode (burnout alert)

---

### 📉 The Harsh Reality of Today

- 🔺 **Mass layoffs** in global tech industry  
- 🔻 **Startup collapse** and hiring freezes  
- ⚖️ **Massive oversupply** of junior tech talent  
- 🧠 **Overqualification paradox** (companies fear risk, not just inexperience)  

Result? Even solid portfolios get ignored.

### 💡 Why This Is Not My Fault

I’m not failing.  
I’m navigating **an era of structural imbalance**:

- If it were a balanced job market, I’d already be employed.
- What I lack in formal employment, I replace with **real project ownership**.
- I build. I write. I push commits. I document.

That’s more real than fluff-filled résumés.

### 🧱 My Response

- ✅ Continue building with consistency
- 📜 Document everything at [Reltroner Studio](https://reltroner.com)
- ⚔️ Treat this as a **preparation arc**, not a failure arc
- 🔥 Convert every rejection into fuel

---

### 🧭 What I Seek

Not just a job —  
I seek a company with:

- Meritocracy  
- Clear structure  
- Respectful culture  
- Fair compensation  

And if I don’t find it?

I will **build it**.
