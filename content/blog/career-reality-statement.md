## üìÑ Career Reality Statement

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about lacking skills.  
> It‚Äôs about surviving a broken system.‚Äù

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è My Current Condition

- üéì Studied Information Systems (with academic turbulence)
- üíº No full-time job yet
- üíª Actively building [Reltroner.com](https://reltroner.com)
- üí∞ Low cash left for survival
- üîã Currently in energy recovery mode (burnout alert)

---

### üìâ The Harsh Reality of Today

- üî∫ **Mass layoffs** in global tech industry  
- üîª **Startup collapse** and hiring freezes  
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Massive oversupply** of junior tech talent  
- üß† **Overqualification paradox** (companies fear risk, not just inexperience)  

Result? Even solid portfolios get ignored.

---

### üí° Why This Is Not My Fault

I‚Äôm not failing.  
I‚Äôm navigating **an era of structural imbalance**:

- If it were a balanced job market, I‚Äôd already be employed.
- What I lack in formal employment, I replace with **real project ownership**.
- I build. I write. I push commits. I document.

That‚Äôs more real than fluff-filled r√©sum√©s.

---

### üß± My Response

- ‚úÖ Continue building with consistency
- üìú Document everything at [Reltroner Studio](https://reltroner.com)
- ‚öîÔ∏è Treat this as a **preparation arc**, not a failure arc
- üî• Convert every rejection into fuel

---

### üß≠ What I Seek

Not just a job ‚Äî  
I seek a company with:

- Meritocracy  
- Clear structure  
- Respectful culture  
- Fair compensation  

And if I don‚Äôt find it?

I will **build it**.

# Why I Reject The Corporate Path in Indonesia

## 1. The Outdated Hierarchy

The majority of corporate structures in Indonesia are deeply feudal. Bosses are often out of touch with the realities of younger generations, especially Gen Z. They value obedience over innovation and discourage questions or challenges. This stifles growth and undermines meritocracy.

## 2. The Boomer Mindset

Many top executives still operate with a 1980s mindset. They often reject or misunderstand modern technology, remote collaboration, or the digital-first economy. Instead of adapting, they cling to legacy practices, expecting employees to adjust to outdated systems and norms.

## 3. Low Wages, High Exploitation

Despite requiring degrees, certifications, and work experience, many jobs offer salaries that are lower than those found in informal work like ride-hailing or UMKM (small business). Meanwhile, companies demand overtime, inflexible hours, and emotional labor without fair compensation.

## 4. Bureaucratic Pressure and Burnout

Corporate Indonesia often mimics the worst aspects of formal education: strict attendance, administrative rituals, unrealistic KPIs, and performance reviews that reduce humans to spreadsheets. It's not about talent or creativity‚Äîit's about fitting into their mold.

## 5. Formal Education Feeds the System

University curriculums are mostly designed to produce obedient employees, not independent creators or critical thinkers. Financial literacy, taxation, and entrepreneurial freedom are rarely taught‚Äîbecause the system doesn't benefit from too many people becoming free.

## 6. I Am Not Designed For This System

As someone with ADHD and neurodivergence, I cannot thrive in rigid hierarchies or under emotionally oppressive bosses. My brain is designed for curiosity, creativity, and high-level exploration‚Äînot endless reporting and shallow tasks that block deeper thought.

## 7. My Mission Is Bigger

I‚Äôd rather build something meaningful‚Äîlike Reltroner Studio‚Äîthan spend my life making someone else rich while suffocating in meetings and redundant workflows. My rejection isn‚Äôt emotional; it‚Äôs strategic. I choose to walk my own path‚Äîeven if it's longer, lonelier, and filled with unknowns.

## 8. Let Astralis Light the Unknown

The goal isn‚Äôt comfort, but sovereignty. Not just income, but impact. Not just a title, but legacy. This is why I reject the corporate path in Indonesia.

I am not lost. I am just walking away from chains that don‚Äôt deserve me.
