# Real Cost Hidden in ERP Systems: A Developer’s Hard Lesson

As a solo developer building **Reltroner ERP**, I’ve always believed that technology should empower—not burden—teams. I started with a simple idea: deliver modular ERP systems that are efficient, customizable, and aligned with the philosophy of creative system architecture. But there was one thing I didn’t fully account for:

> **The hidden cost of hosting ERP in production.**

## It All Started with Railway Hosting

I deployed my HRM module at [hrm.reltroner.com](https://hrm.reltroner.com) on Railway. My expectations? $5 per month. The reality? **$52 per month.**

Why? The project size had ballooned to **62.5 MB**—not massive by most standards, but enough to exceed Railway’s free or expected tier boundaries. That was my wake-up call.

## Odoo vs. Reltroner ERP

This experience made me reflect deeply on why I started this project in the first place. Tools like Odoo are powerful, yes—but they’re also **bloated** and **expensive** to host, especially for small teams that only need 1 or 2 modules. You can’t just “disable” unused modules and expect the cost to go away.

With **Reltroner ERP**, I had one goal:

> **Extreme modularity and lightweight deployment.**

The HRM module I built is **smaller in size and resource use** compared to Odoo, and can be deployed independently, making it ideal for startups who want to own their stack without technical debt.

## Realization: My Greatest Portfolio Is Born From Scarcity

I don’t have a college degree. I’ve never worked at a big company. But through this process, I’ve realized:

- I build with **cost-efficiency** in mind.
- I think in terms of **total system sustainability**, not just feature checklists.
- I understand the **financial burden** that ERP can bring if built carelessly.

And that makes my portfolio **not just unique—but powerful**.

## Final Thought

This wasn’t just a tech lesson. It was a financial awakening.

So to every solo founder, junior dev, or non-traditional builder reading this: **optimize everything.** Don’t assume low usage equals low cost. Measure, test, and always be skeptical of assumptions—even your own.

And to future collaborators and clients:
- If you value lean systems,
- If you care about cost transparency,
- And if you believe tech should be built with long-term impact in mind...

Let’s talk.
