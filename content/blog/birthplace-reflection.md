## 🌍 **Narrative: Two Paths of Birth**

### 🇨🇭 **If Born in Switzerland/Nordic**

Had I been born in Switzerland or the Nordic countries…
Perhaps from childhood I would have seen clean streets, punctual public transport, free world-class schools, and citizens who were disciplined and polite.

I would never have seen bus stops burned during protests or public facilities destroyed by mobs. Demonstrations in my country would have been orderly, structured, and even protected by the protesters themselves to avoid damaging public property.

My life would likely feel calmer: no shame when my nation is criticized internationally. I could have focused on research, personal growth, and pursuing dreams, without constantly being forced to accept bitter realities. Almost like living in a **real Astralis Pinnacle**.

### 🇮🇩 **But I Was Born in Indonesia**

The truth is: I was born in Indonesia.
A country still wrestling with poverty, corruption, unemployment, anarchic protests, and a reputation often tarnished abroad.

Here, I often feel cursed — because every time I try to focus on growth, reality drags me back into the shadow of the **Nytherion Abyss**: collective ignorance, emotional masses, and the lack of public discipline.

Yet it is precisely because I was born here that I was forged.
I learned that the real world is flawed, full of illusion, full of absurdity. And that if I want perfection, I must **build it myself** — through Reltronland, through Astralis Pinnacle, through personal discipline and relentless creation.

### 🌌 **Two Roads, One Destiny**

If I were born in Switzerland/Nordic → I might have only been a citizen enjoying the system.
But because I was born in Indonesia → I was forced to become a **system creator.**

I realize that even though I was born in what I see as a curse, from this place I discovered my greatest mission:

> **to build Reltronland — a civilisation where citizens no longer live with adolescent mentalities, but with Astralis maturity.**

---

✨ So, even though I envy Switzerland and the Nordics, I know: my life path is different. I am not merely a recipient of civilisation — I am preparing myself to become a **civilisation architect.**
