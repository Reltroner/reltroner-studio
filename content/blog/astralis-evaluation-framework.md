# ⚖️ Astralis-Based Developer Evaluation Framework

> _“We don’t just assess skills. We evaluate awareness, endurance, and the will to reject the Abyss.”_  
> — Legacy Principle of Reltroner Studio

## 🧭 Purpose

This framework is designed to assess developers beyond technical ability — by evaluating their mindset, consistency, and legacy orientation through **Astralis Core Values**. It ensures alignment with long-term value creation, not just short-term output.

---

## 🏗️ Structure of the Framework

The developer is assessed across **3 Core Astralis Pillars**, each with 4 indicators:

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔺 **Red Pill Clarity** | Self-awareness, realism, and mental independence from illusions |
| 🔥 **Relentless Execution** | Discipline, resilience, and consistent delivery despite adversity |
| 🌌 **Legacy Orientation** | Vision, creativity, and meaningful contribution beyond oneself |

---

## 1️⃣ 🔺 Red Pill Clarity

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Self-Awareness | Honestly aware of one’s strengths and limitations |
| Error Ownership | Takes full responsibility for mistakes and bugs |
| Anti-Delusion | Free from tutorial-dependency and comfort zone illusions |
| Blueprint Thinking | Has a clear, realistic learning and career strategy |

---

## 2️⃣ 🔥 Relentless Execution

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Daily Practice | Codes regularly without being forced by deadlines |
| Error Documentation | Builds a personal error log or troubleshooting system |
| Real Project Completion | Builds real, functional apps (not just following tutorials) |
| Resilience | Keeps going through bugs, rejections, and mental burnout |

---

## 3️⃣ 🌌 Legacy Orientation

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Vision Clarity | Has a strong sense of long-term purpose (5–10 years) |
| Unique Creations | Builds original systems, tools, frameworks, or worldbuilding |
| Community Impact | Shares value or helps others grow technically |
| Anti-Stagnation | Actively pushes past “safe zones” and comfort patterns |

---

## 🧮 Scoring System

Each indicator is rated on a scale of `0 – 4`:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0 | No trace of this value present |
| 1 | Highly dependent or unaware |
| 2 | Currently developing the value |
| 3 | Shows mature alignment with the value |
| 4 | This value is a personal strength or identity core |

> **Maximum Score: 48 points**  
> *(16 indicators × 3 pillars × 4 max score)*

---

## 🧠 Astralis Developer Ranking

| Score Range | Astralis Rank |
|-------------|----------------|
| 0 – 12 | ⚫ Abyss Bound (No awareness) |
| 13 – 24 | 🔘 Red Pill Initiator (Breaking illusions) |
| 25 – 36 | 🔴 Astralis Climber (Consistently ascending) |
| 37 – 44 | 🔺 Legacy Architect (Building real long-term value) |
| 45 – 48 | 🌌 System Shaper (Top 0.1%, transforms environments) |

---

## ✅ Final Notes

This framework is not meant to judge others.  
It is designed to **help every developer reflect, track, and grow through clarity and purpose**.

> _“Skill grows over time,  
> but direction and legacy only belong to those who choose to rise.”_

Let Astralis light your code.  
Let your work echo beyond time.
