# ⚖️ Astralis-Based Developer Evaluation Framework

> _“We don’t just assess skills. We evaluate awareness, endurance, and the will to reject the Abyss.”_  
> — Legacy Principle of Reltroner Studio

## 🧭 Purpose

This framework is designed to assess developers beyond technical ability — by evaluating their mindset, consistency, and legacy orientation through **Astralis Core Values**. It ensures alignment with long-term value creation, not just short-term output.

---

## 🏗️ Structure of the Framework

The developer is assessed across **3 Core Astralis Pillars**, each with 4 indicators:

### 🔺 Red Pill Clarity
- Self-awareness  
- Realism  
- Mental independence from illusions

### 🔥 Relentless Execution
- Discipline  
- Resilience  
- Consistent delivery despite adversity

### 🌌 Legacy Orientation
- Vision  
- Creativity  
- Meaningful contribution beyond oneself

---

## 1️⃣ 🔺 Red Pill Clarity


### ✅ Self-Awareness
- Honestly aware of one’s strengths and limitations

### ⚠️ Error Ownership
- Takes full responsibility for mistakes and bugs

### 🧠 Anti-Delusion
- Free from tutorial-dependency and comfort zone illusions

### 🏗️ Blueprint Thinking
- Has a clear, realistic learning and career strategy


---

## 2️⃣ 🔥 Relentless Execution

### 💻 Daily Practice
- Codes regularly without being forced by deadlines

### 📒 Error Documentation
- Builds a personal error log or troubleshooting system

### 🚀 Real Project Completion
- Builds real, functional apps (not just following tutorials)

### 🛡️ Resilience
- Keeps going through bugs, rejections, and mental burnout

---

## 3️⃣ 🌌 Legacy Orientation

### 🌠 Vision Clarity
- Has a strong sense of long-term purpose (5–10 years)

### 🛠️ Unique Creations
- Builds original systems, tools, frameworks, or worldbuilding

### 🌍 Community Impact
- Shares value or helps others grow technically

### 🚫 Anti-Stagnation
- Actively pushes past “safe zones” and comfort patterns

---

## 🧮 Scoring System

Each indicator is rated on a scale of `0 – 4`:

### Score Meaning:
- **0** – No trace of this value present  
- **1** – Highly dependent or unaware  
- **2** – Currently developing the value  
- **3** – Shows mature alignment with the value  
- **4** – This value is a personal strength or identity core 

> **Maximum Score: 48 points**  
> *(16 indicators × 3 pillars × 4 max score)*

It is designed to **help every developer reflect, track, and grow through clarity and purpose**.

> _“Skill grows over time,  
> but direction and legacy only belong to those who choose to rise.”_

Let Astralis light your code.  
Let your work echo beyond time.
