# 🃏 Rei & Joker  
## *Reflections of Rebellion*

Two minds from different worlds.  
Two hearts that rejected false comfort.  
When **Rei Reltroner**, the Astralis Architect, met **Joker**, the Phantom Trickster, the universe witnessed a bond beyond illusion.

## 🌌 Origins of Friendship

- **Location:** Between realities — Twilight Terminal  
- **First encounter:** A clash of philosophies  
- **What formed the bond?**  
  They both knew what it meant to rebel — not just against a system, but against the **illusion of ease and conformity**.

> *“I don’t just see through the lie,” Rei said, “I destroy it.”*  
> *“Then we’re the same,” Joker replied with a smirk. “Let’s rewrite the script.”*
