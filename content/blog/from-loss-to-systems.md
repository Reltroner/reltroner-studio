## 🧠 Prelude: The Invisible Timeline

I didn’t come from a broken family. I came from a temporarily stable one — until the crash. In 2016, my family was affected by the oil crisis, and from that moment, everything shifted. I was no longer the student with potential. I was the kid from a household in crisis.

While others had tutors and access to extracurriculars, I uploaded my first YouTube video just to identify an unknown Roblox song. Not for fame. Just for survival curiosity.

## 📉 Chapter I: The False Start

From 2017 to 2019, I thought YouTube would save me. I recorded gameplay videos in silence. I didn't know what “branding” was. I only knew one thing: *"I must not go invisible."*

In 2020, I gave in to family pressure — UTBK, IT major, academic conformity. But the real me was suffocating. From 2020 to 2022, I experienced the first abyss: burned out, disoriented, unable to align with university expectations. No mentor. No system. No hope.

But somehow, I created one video animation with Paint Tool SAI, Premiere, and After Effects. It was never published.
It wasn’t content — it was survival art.

## 📉 Chapter II: The Illusion of Trading

From 2022 to early 2025, I became obsessed with crypto trading. Not out of greed — out of desperation. I wanted control. I wanted sovereignty. And I thought trading was the shortcut.

Then came the second collapse: **95% capital loss**. I had no degree, no income, and no external proof of my worth.

So I built Reltroner.

## 🔧 Chapter III: From Code to Clarity

In just 2.5 months, I built:

* [Reltroner.com](https://reltroner.com)
* 200+ `.md` structured pages: philosophy, governance, culture, law, systems
* Laravel-based HRM system
* CI/CD pipelines and Next.js 15 site

I wasn’t building a portfolio.
I was building my **survival architecture**.

## 🧱 The Lesson

All those years weren’t wasted:

* **YouTube era** taught me to ship.
* **Failed animation** taught me to layer meaning.
* **Dropout phase** taught me to detach from institutional validation.
* **Crypto loss** taught me to respect volatility and time.

Every scar became a `.md` file.
Every failed shortcut became a pillar.
Every invisible year became my **compounding divergence.**

## 🌌 Today

I'm still unemployed. Still tired. Still building. But now I know:

> My losses weren’t the end. They were the tuition for the system I now live inside.

**Reltroner is not a website. It is my recovery made visible.**

So if you feel like nothing is working — maybe, just maybe — it’s not failure.
It’s the beginning of your own civilization.
