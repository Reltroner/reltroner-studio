# 🩸 The Feeding Stair

## 🔍 What Is the Feeding Stair?

**The Feeding Stair** is a deceptive spiral-like structure located deep within the **Nytherion Abyss Core**. Though it appears to be a staircase, it is actually a semi-sentient construct that mimics physical descent, luring wanderers into an irreversible fall — **not downward, but inward**.

---

## 🧠 Why It’s Not a Stair

- It does not maintain symmetrical step design
- Its red glow resembles organic tissue rather than architectural material
- It contracts — not metaphorically, but **biologically**
- The longer you look, the more it resembles a **throat**, not a path

> “The spiral is not geometry. It is **digestion**.”

---

## 📍 Psychological Impact

Wanderers often feel:
- Drawn to it with calmness, not fear
- Convinced that it offers escape or revelation
- Dissociation from surroundings while approaching it

These symptoms are signs of **Abyssal Lure**, a condition triggered by long exposure to deceptive abyss formations.

## 🌀 Philosophical Reflection

> “The spiral does not descend. It pretends to lead you somewhere… while feeding on the act of you walking.”

This structure symbolizes Nytherion’s true horror: **false direction.**
It doesn’t harm you outright — it makes you harm yourself by trusting it.

> If the steps ripple, if your spine tightens, and if you feel like you're being invited in…
> **Turn around.**

Let Astralis light the unknown — and guide your steps **away from hunger disguised as hope.**
