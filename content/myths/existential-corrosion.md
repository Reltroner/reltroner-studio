## üß† What is Existential Corrosion?

**Existential Corrosion** is a catastrophic abyssal effect that targets not the body, but the very concept of someone‚Äôs existence.  
Once activated, it begins **to erase a person from memory, narrative, records, and even emotional traces**.

This is **not death**.  
This is **obliteration of presence**.
