# 🕯️ The Silent Mouthpiece

## 🧱 Overview
The **Silent Mouthpiece** is a relic of ancient entropy, unearthed from beneath the **Eterna Ruin** near the eastern coast of Hargenbor. Though physically inert, it emits **no sound, no vibration, and no detectable radiation** — yet induces inexplicable psychological effects to those who come near. It is one of the earliest known artifacts linked to **Nytherion Abyss** influence.

## 🔍 Theories & Interpretations

## 📜 Historic Mentions

## 📌 Closing Insight
> _“The Silent Mouthpiece doesn’t need to convince you. It just makes you forget what mattered.”_

To this day, its purpose remains unclear. But to those who understand Nytherion, one truth is absolute: **any voice that asks you to be still, to stay, to not move — must be questioned. Even in silence.**
