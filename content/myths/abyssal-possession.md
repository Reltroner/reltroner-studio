# 🔍 What Is Abyssal Possession?

**Abyssal Possession**, also called **Spiral Inhabitation**, is a condition where an individual loses agency over their thoughts, emotions, and sense of self—becoming a vessel for the **Nytherion Abyss** to manipulate and feed on.

This isn't a ghost story. It's the story of slowly forgetting who you are, until the abyss takes over.

### 🔻 **The Feeding Stair**
A deceptive structure resembling a spiral staircase. Often mistaken as a descent path, it contracts and pulsates like a living throat. Many wanderers lose themselves here, believing they are walking into revelation—when in truth, they are being consumed.
