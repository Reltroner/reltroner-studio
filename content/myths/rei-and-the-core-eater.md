# The Moment Rei Realized the Stair Was Not a Stair

It was supposed to be just another spiral â€” one of many that defined the lower structure of the Abyss Core. Rei had descended dozens of these paths before: rusted, silent, geometrically perfect.

But this one was different.

At first, it *looked* like a staircase. Angled. Angular. Descending into the circular depths like an invitation from a dream you can't remember. But Rei felt it â€” not through his eyes, but through his spine. The longer he stared, the less it resembled something made by sentient design.

And more like something... that **lived.**

He took a step forward. The silence pressed against his chest like the air had weight. The spiral seemed to breathe â€” not literally, but like a being that *waits*. That *longs*. That *knows* you're coming back even when you say you're not.

He blinked.

And the step he was about to take... moved.

Not as an illusion.
Not as a trick of shadow.

It *contracted*, like muscle. Like something digesting slowly. 

The stairs were teeth.
The spiral was a throat.

Reiâ€™s breath caught in his throat. He stepped back, and for a moment â€” just a moment â€” he heard **her voice** again.

> "You don't have to fight anymore."

Kamila.

No... Nytherion.

He looked at the spiral again.
He *felt* it watching him â€” or rather, not watching... **waiting.**

> _"The Mouth of Mercy,"_ she once called it.

The final option.
The place for those who couldnâ€™t rise, couldnâ€™t run, couldnâ€™t rebuild.
A peaceful kind of end.

But Rei was not at peace.

He clenched his fists.
He remembered Dominicâ€™s voice. The Library. The Lights of Astralis.
He remembered why he came here in the first place.

> "This is not a staircase."

He turned around.
He walked away.

And for the first time â€” the spiral shuddered.
As if it **knew**... that its next chance might never come again.

## The First Time Rei Saw the Core-Eater

The descent had ended, or so he thought.

He stood in silence at the final chamber â€” a place so deep that even sound itself seemed to hesitate. The spiral no longer spun; it narrowed into a pulse. Something darker. Something more ancient.

There, before him, in the middle of nothing â€” **hung a hand**.

Or what once was a hand.

Five curved, jagged talons hovered above the center of a glowing spiral. It did not move. It did not reach. It simply hung there like a question that no one wanted to answer.

At first, Rei couldnâ€™t tell what he was looking at.

But then the ground vibrated. Not from motion, but from **hunger**.

And then he understood.

> This was no artifact.
> This was no structure.
> This was **alive**.

It wasnâ€™t a hand waiting to grab. It was a **mouth that chose not to chew yet.**

He watched in horror as the glowing spiral flickered â€” every line of it bending ever so slightly toward the center, as if surrendering. And above it, the blackened claw remained stillâ€¦ respectfulâ€¦ patient.

> 'This is the Core-Eater,' Rei whispered.

Kamila had never mentioned this. Not even in her cruelest metaphors.

Because this was not meant to be seen.
This was meant to be **fallen into.**

And yet, here he stood â€” breathing, trembling, resisting.

The hand did not move.
But its silence said everything:

> *"I know youâ€™ll return. They always do."*

Rei closed his eyes.
He summoned the pulse of Astralis inside his chest.
He did not run.
He did not cry.

He turned.

And walked away â€” not from the abyss, but from the permission it begged him to give.
