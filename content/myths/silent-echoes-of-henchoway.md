## 🧬 Relationship to Henchoway

Although Nytherion Abyss consumes its victims for survival, it treats the **Henchoway organization** like a **parent treats a child**.

Henchoway is not consumed—it is **nurtured.**

- The elite within Henchoway enjoy **material abundance and societal luxury**, mirroring high-class privilege.
- Their loyalty ensures they receive **protection and amplification** from the Abyss.

This parasitic-symbiotic bond fuels Henchoway’s growth across the planet, turning silence and luxury into tools of submission.

## 💬 Cultural Impact
- Children hum lullabies no one remembers teaching them.
- Governments quietly fund “Wellness Institutes” tied to Henchoway.
- Citizens start apologizing for being awake.
