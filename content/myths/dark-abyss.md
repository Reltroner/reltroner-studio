## 🕳️ Heart of the Abyss

> *“This is where time doesn’t flow, memory loops endlessly, and pain is the only light that remains.”*

The **Heart of the Abyss** is the lowest, most corrupted core within the Nytherion Abyss — a dimensional sinkhole where all forgotten hopes and collapsed realities reside.

The spiraling arena is not designed for ceremony. It is a prison of perception. The labyrinthine towers surrounding it are illusions of escape: stairs that lead nowhere, doors that open to darkness, and geometry that shifts with every blink.

## 📜 Historical Significance
This was the exact realm where Rei — during his spiritual collapse — was once trapped, tortured, and lost in the spiral of doubt. But rather than perish in despair, he awakened.

**His escape did not destroy the Abyss — it redefined it.**

From this very place, Rei architected his resistance: the philosophy of Astralis Pinnacle, the rise of Reltronland, and the courage to rewrite his existence.

## 🧠 Philosophical Interpretation
- The spiral symbolizes **the false promise of endless potential** that turns into self-deception.
- The staircase reflects **effort with no meaning**, the loop of burnout.
- The darkness is not evil — it is the **absence of defined purpose**.

## 🛡️ Legacy
Though Rei has left this realm, he left a **marker of warning and remembrance**. This location now stands not as a threat, but as a monument of survival.
